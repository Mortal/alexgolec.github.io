        Dickens is one of those writers who are well worth stealing. Even the burial
        of his body in Westminster Abbey was a species of theft, if you come to think
        of it.</p>
        <p>When Chesterton wrote his introductions to the Everyman Edition of Dickens&rsquo;s
        works, it seemed quite natural to him to credit Dickens with his own highly
        individual brand of medievalism, and more recently a Marxist writer, Mr. T. A.
        Jackson, has made spirited efforts to turn Dickens into a blood-thirsty
        revolutionary. The Marxist claims him as &ldquo;almost&rdquo; a Marxist, the Catholic
        claims him as &ldquo;almost&rdquo; a Catholic, and both claim him as a champion of the
        proletariat (or &ldquo;the poor,&rdquo; as Chesterton would have put it). On the other
        hand, Nadezhda Krupskaya, in her little book on Lenin, relates that towards the
        end of his life Lenin went to see a dramatized version of <i>The Cricket on the Hearth</i>,
        and found Dickens&rsquo;s &ldquo;middle-class sentimentality&rdquo; so intolerable that
        he walked out in the middle of a scene.</p>
        <p>Taking &ldquo;middle-class&rdquo; to mean what Krupskaya might be expected to mean by
        it, this was probably a truer judgement than those of Chesterton and Jackson.
        But it is worth noticing that the dislike of Dickens implied in this remark is
        something unusual. Plenty of people have found him unreadable, but very few
        seem to have felt any hostility towards the general spirit of his work. Some
        years later Mr. Bechhofer Roberts published a full-length attack on Dickens in
        the form of a novel (<i>This Side Idolatry</i>), but it was a merely personal attack,
        concerned for the most part with Dickens&rsquo;s treatment of his wife. It dealt with
        incidents which not one in a thousand of Dickens&rsquo;s readers would ever hear
        about, and which no more invalidates his work than the second-best bed
        invalidates <i>Hamlet</i>. All that the book really demonstrated was that a writer&rsquo;s
        literary personality has little or nothing to do with his private character. It
        is quite possible that in private life Dickens was just the kind of insensitive
        egoist that Mr. Bechhofer Roberts makes him appear. But in his published work
        there is implied a personality quite different from this, a personality which
        has won him far more friends than enemies. It might well have been otherwise,
        for even if Dickens was a bourgeois, he was certainly a subversive writer, a
        radical, one might truthfully say a rebel. Everyone who has read widely in his
        work has felt this. Gissing, for instance, the best of the writers on Dickens,
        was anything but a radical himself, and he disapproved of this strain in
        Dickens and wished it were not there, but it never occurred to him to deny it.
        In <i>Oliver Twist</i>, <i>Hard Times</i>, <i>Bleak House</i>, <i>Little Dorrit</i>, Dickens attacked
        English institutions with a ferocity that has never since been approached. Yet
        he managed to do it without making himself hated, and, more than this, the very
        people he attacked have swallowed him so completely that he has become a
        national institution himself. In its attitude towards Dickens the English
        public has always been a little like the elephant which feels a blow with a
        walking-stick as a delightful tickling. Before I was ten years old I was having
        Dickens ladled down my throat by schoolmasters in whom even at that age I could
        see a strong resemblance to Mr. Creakle, and one knows without needing to be
        told that lawyers delight in Sergeant Buzfuz and that <i>Little Dorrit</i> is a
        favourite in the Home Office. Dickens seems to have succeeded in attacking
        everybody and antagonizing nobody. Naturally this makes one wonder whether
        after all there was something unreal in his attack upon society. Where exactly
        does he stand, socially, morally, and politically? As usual, one can define his
        position more easily if one starts by deciding what he was <i>not</i>.</p>
        <p>In the first place he was <i>not</i>, as Messrs. Chesterton and Jackson seem to
        imply, a &ldquo;proletarian&rdquo; writer. To begin with, he does not write about the
        proletariat, in which he merely resembles the overwhelming majority of
        novelists, past and present. If you look for the working classes in fiction,
        and especially English fiction, all you find is a hole. This statement needs
        qualifying, perhaps. For reasons that are easy enough to see, the agricultural
        labourer (in England a proletarian) gets a fairly good showing in fiction, and
        a great deal has been written about criminals, derelicts and, more recently,
        the working-class intelligentsia. But the ordinary town proletariat, the people
        who make the wheels go round, have always been ignored by novelists. When they
        do find their way between the covers of a book, it is nearly always as objects
        of pity or as comic relief. The central action of Dickens&rsquo;s stories almost
        invariably takes place in middle-class surroundings. If one examines his novels
        in detail one finds that his real subject-matter is the London commercial
        bourgeoisie and their hangers-on&ndash;lawyers, clerks, tradesmen, innkeepers,
        small craftsmen, and servants. He has no portrait of an agricultural worker,
        and only one (Stephen Blackpool in <i>Hard Times</i>) of an industrial worker. The
        Plornishes in <i>Little Dorrit</i> are probably his best picture of a working-class
        family&ndash;the Peggottys, for instance, hardly belong to the working
        class&ndash;but on the whole he is not successful with this type of character.
        If you ask any ordinary reader which of Dickens&rsquo;s proletarian characters he can
        remember, the three he is almost certain to mention are Bill Sykes, Sam Weller,
        and Mrs. Gamp. A burglar, a valet, and a drunken midwife&ndash;not exactly a
        representative cross-section of the English working class.</p>
        <p>Secondly, in the ordinarily accepted sense of the word, Dickens is not a
        &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; writer. But his position here needs some defining.</p>
        <p>Whatever else Dickens may have been, he was not a hole-and-corner
        soul-saver, the kind of well-meaning idiot who thinks that the world will be
        perfect if you amend a few bylaws and abolish a few anomalies. It is worth
        comparing him with Charles Reade, for instance. Reade was a much
        better-informed man than Dickens, and in some ways more public-spirited. He
        really hated the abuses he could understand, he showed them up in a series of
        novels which for all their absurdity are extremely readable, and he probably
        helped to alter public opinion on a few minor but important points. But it was
        quite beyond him to grasp that, given the existing form of society, certain
        evils <i>cannot</i> be remedied. Fasten upon this or that minor abuse, expose it, drag
        it into the open, bring it before a British jury, and all will be well that is
        how he sees it. Dickens at any rate never imagined that you can cure pimples by
        cutting them off. In every page of his work one can see a consciousness that
        society is wrong somewhere at the root. It is when one asks &ldquo;Which root?&rdquo; that
        one begins to grasp his position.</p>
        <p>The truth is that Dickens&rsquo;s criticism of society is almost exclusively
        moral. Hence the utter lack of any constructive suggestion anywhere in his
        work. He attacks the law, parliamentary government, the educational system and
        so forth, without ever clearly suggesting what he would put in their places. Of
        course it is not necessarily the business of a novelist, or a satirist, to make
        constructive suggestions, but the point is that Dickens&rsquo;s attitude is at bottom
        not even destructive. There is no clear sign that he wants the existing order
        to be overthrown, or that he believes it would make very much difference if it
        <i>were</i> overthrown. For in reality his target is not so much society as &ldquo;human
        nature.&rdquo; It would be difficult to point anywhere in his books to a passage
        suggesting that the economic system is wrong <i>as a system</i>. Nowhere, for
        instance, does he make any attack on private enterprise or private property.
        Even in a book like <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, which turns on the power of corpses to
        interfere with living people by means of idiotic wills, it does not occur to
        him to suggest that individuals ought not to have this irresponsible power. Of
        course one can draw this inference for oneself, and one can draw it again from
        the remarks about Bounderby&rsquo;s will at the end of <i>Hard Times</i>, and indeed from
        the whole of Dickens&rsquo;s work one can infer the evil of <i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism;
        but Dickens makes no such inference himself. It is said that Macaulay refused
        to review <i>Hard Times</i> because he disapproved of its &ldquo;sullen Socialism.&rdquo;
        Obviously Macaulay is here using the word &ldquo;Socialism&rdquo; in the same sense in
        which, twenty years ago, a vegetarian meal or a Cubist picture used to be
        referred to as &ldquo;Bolshevism.&rdquo; There is not a line in the book that can properly
        be called Socialistic; indeed, its tendency if anything is pro-capitalist,
        because its whole moral is that capitalists ought to be kind, not that workers
        ought to be rebellious. Bounder by is a bullying windbag and Gradgrind has been
        morally blinded, but if they were better men, the system would work well enough
        that, all through, is the implication. And so far as social criticism goes, one
        can never extract much more from Dickens than this, unless one deliberately
        reads meanings into him. His whole &ldquo;message&rdquo; is one that at first glance looks
        like an enormous platitude: If men would behave decently the world would be
        decent.</p>
        <p>Naturally this calls for a few characters who are in positions of authority
        and who <i>do</i> behave decently. Hence that recurrent Dickens figure, the good rich
        man. This character belongs especially to Dickens&rsquo;s early optimistic period. He
        is usually a &ldquo;merchant&rdquo; (we are not necessarily told what merchandise he deals
        in), and he is always a superhumanly kind-hearted old gentleman who &ldquo;trots&rdquo; to
        and fro, raising his employees&rsquo; wages, patting children on the head, getting
        debtors out of jail and in general, acting the fairy godmother. Of course he is
        a pure dream figure, much further from real life than, say, Squeers or
        Micawber. Even Dickens must have reflected occasionally that anyone who was so
        anxious to give his money away would never have acquired it in the first place.
        Mr. Pickwick, for instance, had &ldquo;been in the city,&rdquo; but it is difficult to
        imagine him making a fortune there. Nevertheless this character runs like a
        connecting thread through most of the earlier books. Pickwick, the Cheerybles,
        old Chuzzlewit, Scrooge&ndash;it is the same figure over and over again, the
        good rich man, handing out guineas. Dickens does however show signs of
        development here. In the books of the middle period the good rich man fades out
        to some extent. There is no one who plays this part in <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>,
        nor in <i>Great Expectations</i>&ndash;<i>Great Expectations</i> is, in fact, definitely an
        attack on patronage&ndash;and in <i>Hard Times</i> it is only very doubtfully played
        by Gradgrind after his reformation. The character reappears in a rather
        different form as Meagles in <i>Little Dorrit</i> and John Jarndyce in <i>Bleak House</i>&ndash;one might perhaps add Betsy Trotwood in <i>David Copperfield</i>. But in
        these books the good rich man has dwindled from a &ldquo;merchant&rdquo; to a <i>rentier</i>. This
        is significant. A <i>rentier</i> is part of the possessing class, he can and, almost
        without knowing it, does make other people work for him, but he has very little
        direct power. Unlike Scrooge or the Cheerybles, he cannot put everything right
        by raising everybody&rsquo;s wages. The seeming inference from the rather despondent
        books that Dickens wrote in the fifties is that by that time he had grasped the
        helplessness of well-meaning individuals in a corrupt society. Nevertheless in
        the last completed novel, <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> (published 1864-5), the good rich
        man comes back in full glory in the person of Boffin. Boffin is a proletarian
        by origin and only rich by inheritance, but he is the usual <i>deus ex machina</i>,
        solving everybody&rsquo;s problems by showering money in all directions. He even
        &ldquo;trots,&rdquo; like the Cheerybles. In several ways <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is a return to
        the earlier manner, and not an unsuccessful return either. Dickens&rsquo;s thoughts
        seem to have come full circle. Once again, individual kindliness is the remedy
        for everything.</p>
        <p>One crying evil of his time that Dickens says very little about is child
        labour. There are plenty of pictures of suffering children in his books, but
        usually they are suffering in schools rather than in factories. The one
        detailed account of child labour that he gives is the description in <i>David Copperfield</i>
        of little David washing bottles in Murdstone &amp; Grinby&rsquo;s
        warehouse. This, of course, is autobiography. Dickens himself, at the age of
        ten, had worked in Warren&rsquo;s blacking factory in the Strand, very much as he
        describes it here. It was a terribly bitter memory to him, partly because he
        felt the whole incident to be discreditable to his parents, and he even
        concealed it from his wife till long after they were married. Looking back on
        this period, he says in <i>David Copperfield</i>:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          It is a matter of some surprise to me, even now, that I can have been so
          easily thrown away at such an age. A child of excellent abilities and with
          strong powers of observation, quick, eager, delicate, and soon hurt bodily or
          mentally, it seems wonderful to me that nobody should have made any sign in my
          behalf. But none was made; and I became, at ten years old, a little labouring
          hind in the service of Murdstone &amp; Grinby.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>And again, having described the rough boys among whom he worked:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          No words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into this
          companionship&hellip;and felt my hopes of growing up to be a learned and
          distinguished man crushed in my bosom.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Obviously it is not David Copperfield who is speaking, it is Dickens
        himself. He uses almost the same words in the autobiography that he began and
        abandoned a few months earlier. Of course Dickens is right in saying that a
        gifted child ought not to work ten hours a day pasting labels on bottles, but
        what he does not say is that <i>no</i> child ought to be condemned to such a fate, and
        there is no reason for inferring that he thinks it. David escapes from the
        warehouse, but Mick Walker and Mealy Potatoes and the others are still there,
        and there is no sign that this troubles Dickens particularly. As usual, he
        displays no consciousness that the <i>structure</i> of society can be changed. He
        despises politics, does not believe that any good can come out of
        Parliament&ndash;he had been a Parliamentary shorthand writer, which was no
        doubt a disillusioning experience&ndash;and he is slightly hostile to the most
        hopeful movement of his day, trade unionism. In <i>Hard Times</i> trade unionism is
        represented as something not much better than a racket, something that happens
        because employers are not sufficiently paternal. Stephen Blackpool&rsquo;s refusal to
        join the union is rather a virtue in Dickens&rsquo;s eyes. Also, as Mr. Jackson has
        pointed out, the apprentices&rsquo; association in <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>, to which Sim
        Tappertit belongs, is probably a hit at the illegal or barely legal unions of
        Dickens&rsquo;s own day, with their secret assemblies, passwords and so forth.
        Obviously he wants the workers to be decently treated, but there is no sign
        that he wants them to take their destiny into their own hands, least of all by
        open violence.</p>
        <p>As it happens, Dickens deals with revolution in the narrower sense in two
        novels, <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> and <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>. In <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> it is a case
        of rioting rather than revolution. The Gordon Riots of 1780, though they had
        religious bigotry as a pretext, seem to have been little more than a pointless
        outburst of looting. Dickens&rsquo;s attitude to this kind of thing is sufficiently
        indicated by the fact that his first idea was to make the ringleaders of the
        riots three lunatics escaped from an asylum. He was dissuaded from this, but
        the principal figure of the book is in fact a village idiot. In the chapters
        dealing with the riots Dickens shows a most profound horror of mob violence. He
        delights in describing scenes in which the &ldquo;dregs&rdquo; of the population behave
        with atrocious bestiality. These chapters are of great psychological interest,
        because they show how deeply he had brooded on this subject. The things he
        describes can only have come out of his imagination, for no riots on anything
        like the same scale had happened in his lifetime. Here is one of his
        descriptions, for instance:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          If Bedlam gates had been flung open wide, there would not have issued forth
          such maniacs as the frenzy of that night had made. There were men there who
          danced and trampled on the beds of flowers as though they trod down human
          enemies, and wrenched them from their stalks, like savages who twisted human
          necks. There were men who cast their lighted torches in the air, and suffered
          them to fall upon their heads and faces, blistering the skin with deep unseemly
          burns. There were men who rushed up to the fire, and paddled in it with their
          hands as if in water; and others who were restrained by force from plunging in,
          to gratify their deadly longing. On the skull of one drunken lad&ndash;not
          twenty, by his looks&ndash;who lay upon the ground with a bottle to his mouth,
          the lead from the roof came streaming down in a shower of liquid fire, white
          hot, melting his head like wax&hellip;But of all the howling throng not one learnt
          mercy from, or sickened at, these sights; nor was the fierce, besotted,
          senseless rage of one man glutted.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You might almost think you were reading a description of &ldquo;Red&rdquo; Spain by a
        partisan of General Franco. One ought, of course, to remember that when Dickens
        was writing, the London &ldquo;mob&rdquo; still existed. (Nowadays there is no mob, only a
        flock.) Low wages and the growth and shift of population had brought into
        existence a huge, dangerous slum-proletariat, and until the early middle of the
        nineteenth century there was hardly such a thing as a police force. When the
        brickbats began to fly there was nothing between shuttering your windows and
        ordering the troops to open fire. In <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> he is dealing with a
        revolution which was really about something, and Dickens&rsquo;s attitude is
        different, but not entirely different. As a matter of fact, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>
        is a book which tends to leave a false impression behind, especially
        after a lapse of time.</p>
        <p>The one thing that everyone who has read <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> remembers is
        the Reign of Terror. The whole book is dominated by the
        guillotine&ndash;tumbrils thundering to and fro, bloody knives, heads bouncing
        into the basket, and sinister old women knitting as they watch. Actually these
        scenes only occupy a few chapters, but they are written with terrible
        intensity, and the rest of the book is rather slow going. But <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>
        is not a companion volume to <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>. Dickens sees clearly
        enough that the French Revolution was bound to happen and that many of the
        people who were executed deserved what they got. If, he says, you behave as the
        French aristocracy had behaved, vengeance will follow. He repeats this over and
        over again. We are constantly being reminded that while &ldquo;my lord&rdquo; is lolling in
        bed, with four liveried footmen serving his chocolate and the peasants starving
        outside, somewhere in the forest a tree is growing which will presently be sawn
        into planks for the platform of the guillotine, etc., etc., etc. The
        inevitability of the Terror, given its causes, is insisted upon in the clearest
        terms:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          It was too much the way&hellip;to talk of this terrible Revolution as if it were
          the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sown&ndash;as if
          nothing had ever been done, or omitted to be done, that had led to it&ndash;as
          if observers of the wretched millions in France, and of the misused and
          perverted resources that should have made them prosperous, had not seen it
          inevitably coming, years before, and had not in plain terms recorded what they
          saw.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>And again:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          All the devouring and insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could
          record itself, are fused in the one realization, Guillotine. And yet there is
          not in France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a
          root, a spring, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more
          certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush humanity out of shape
          once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same
          tortured forms.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In other words, the French aristocracy had dug their own graves. But there
        is no perception here of what is now called historic necessity. Dickens sees
        that the results are inevitable, given the causes, but he thinks that the
        causes might have been avoided. The Revolution is something that happens
        because centuries of oppression have made the French peasantry sub-human. If
        the wicked nobleman could somehow have turned over a new leaf, like Scrooge,
        there would have been no Revolution, no <i>Jacquerie</i>, no guillotine&ndash;and so
        much the better. This is the opposite of the &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; attitude. From the
        &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; point of view the class-struggle is the main source of
        progress, and therefore the nobleman who robs the peasant and goads him to
        revolt is playing a necessary part, just as much as the Jacobin who guillotines
        the nobleman. Dickens never writes anywhere a line that can be interpreted as
        meaning this. Revolution as he sees it is merely a monster that is begotten by
        tyranny and always ends by devouring its own instruments. In Sydney Carton&rsquo;s
        vision at the foot of the guillotine, he foresees Defarge and the other leading
        spirits of the Terror all perishing under the same knife&ndash;which, in fact,
        was approximately what happened.</p>
        <p>And Dickens is very sure that revolution is a monster. That is why everyone
        remembers the revolutionary scenes in <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>; they have the
        quality of nightmare, and it is Dickens&rsquo;s own nightmare. Again and again he
        insists upon the meaningless horrors of revolution&ndash;the mass-butcheries,
        the injustice, the ever-present terror of spies, the frightful blood-lust of
        the mob. The descriptions of the Paris mob&ndash;the description, for instance,
        of the crowd of murderers struggling round the grindstone to sharpen their
        weapons before butchering the prisoners in the September massacres&ndash;outdo
        anything in <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>. The revolutionaries appear to him simply as degraded
        savages&ndash;in fact, as lunatics. He broods over their frenzies with a
        curious imaginative intensity. He describes them dancing the &ldquo;Carmagnole,&rdquo; for
        instance:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and they were dancing
          like five thousand demons&hellip;They danced to the popular Revolution song, keeping
          a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison&hellip;They advanced,
          retreated, struck at one another&rsquo;s hands, clutched at one another&rsquo;s heads, spun
          round alone, caught one another, and spun around in pairs, until many of them
          dropped&hellip;Suddenly they stopped again, paused, struck out the time afresh,
          forming into lines the width of the public way, and, with their heads low down
          and their hands high up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half
          so terrible as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport&ndash;a
          something, once innocent, delivered over to all devilry.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>He even credits some of these wretches with a taste for guillotining
        children. The passage I have abridged above ought to be read in full. It and
        others like it show how deep was Dickens&rsquo;s horror of revolutionary hysteria.
        Notice, for instance that touch, &ldquo;with their heads low down and their hands
        high up,&rdquo; etc., and the evil vision it conveys. Madame Defarge is a truly
        dreadful figure, certainly Dickens&rsquo;s most successful attempt at a <i>malignant</i>
        character. Defarge and others are simply &ldquo;the new oppressors who have risen in
        the destruction of the old,&rdquo; the revolutionary courts are presided over by &ldquo;the
        lowest, cruellest and worst populace,&rdquo; and so on and so forth. All the way
        through Dickens insists upon the nightmare insecurity of a revolutionary
        period, and in this he shows a great deal of prescience. &ldquo;A law of the
        suspected, which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered
        over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged
        with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing&rdquo;&ndash;it
        would apply pretty accurately to several countries today.</p>
        <p>The apologists of any revolution generally try to minimize its horrors;
        Dickens&rsquo;s impulse is to exaggerate them&ndash;and from a historical point of
        view he has certainly exaggerated. Even the Reign of Terror was a much smaller
        thing than he makes it appear. Though he quotes no figures, he gives the
        impression of a frenzied massacre lasting for years, whereas in reality the
        whole of the Terror, so far as the number of deaths goes, was a joke compared
        with one of Napoleon&rsquo;s battles. But the bloody knives and the tumbrils rolling
        to and fro create in his mind a special sinister vision which he has succeeded
        in passing on to generations of readers. Thanks to Dickens, the very word
        &ldquo;tumbril&rdquo; has a murderous sound; one forgets that a tumbril is only a sort of
        farm-cart. To this day, to the average Englishman, the French Revolution means
        no more than a pyramid of severed heads. It is a strange thing that Dickens,
        much more in sympathy with the ideas of the Revolution than most Englishmen of
        his time, should have played a part in creating this impression.</p>
        <p>If you hate violence and don't believe in politics, the only remedy
        remaining is education. Perhaps society is past praying for, but there is
        always hope for the individual human being, if you can catch him young enough.
        This belief partly accounts for Dickens&rsquo;s preoccupation with childhood.</p>
        <p>No one, at any rate no English writer, has written better about childhood
        than Dickens. In spite of all the knowledge that has accumulated since, in
        spite of the fact that children are now comparatively sanely treated, no
        novelist has shown the same power of entering into the child&rsquo;s point of view. I
        must have been about nine years old when I first read <i>David Copperfield</i>. The
        mental atmosphere of the opening chapters was so immediately intelligible to me
        that I vaguely imagined they had been written <i>by a child</i>. And yet when one
        re-reads the book as an adult and sees the Murdstones, for instance, dwindle
        from gigantic figures of doom into semi-comic monsters, these passages lose
        nothing. Dickens has been able to stand both inside and outside the child&rsquo;s
        mind, in such a way that the same scene can be wild burlesque or sinister
        reality, according to the age at which one reads it. Look, for instance, at the
        scene in which David Copperfield is unjustly suspected of eating the mutton
        chops; or the scene in which Pip, in <i>Great Expectations</i>, coming back from Miss
        Havisham&rsquo;s house and finding himself completely unable to describe what he has
        seen, takes refuge in a series of outrageous lies&ndash;which, of course, are
        eagerly believed. All the isolation of childhood is there. And how accurately
        he has recorded the mechanisms of the child&rsquo;s mind, its visualizing tendency,
        its sensitiveness to certain kinds of impression. Pip relates how in his
        childhood his ideas about his dead parents were derived from their
        tombstones:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          The shape of the letters on my father&rsquo;s, gave me an odd idea that he was a
          square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of
          the inscription, &ldquo;<i>Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above,</i>&rdquo; I drew a childish
          conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone
          lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row
          beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of
          mine&hellip;I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all
          been born on their backs with their hands in their trouser-pockets, and had
          never taken them out in this state of existence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is a similar passage in <i>David Copperfield</i>. After biting Mr.
        Murdstone&rsquo;s hand, David is sent away to school and obliged to wear on his back
        a placard saying, &ldquo;Take care of him. He bites.&rdquo; He looks at the door in the
        playground where the boys have carved their names, and from the appearance of
        each name he seems to know in just what tone of voice the boy will read out the
        placard:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          There was one boy&ndash;a certain J. Steerforth&ndash;who cut his name very
          deep and very often, who, I conceived, would read it in a rather strong voice,
          and afterwards pull my hair. There was another boy, one Tommy Traddles, who I
          dreaded would make game of it, and pretend to be dreadfully frightened of me.
          There was a third, George Demple, who I fancied would sing it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When I read this passage as a child, it seemed to me that those were exactly
        the pictures that those particular names would call up. The reason, of course,
        is the sound-associations of the words (Demple&ndash;&ldquo;temple;&rdquo;
        Traddles&ndash;probably &ldquo;skedaddle&rdquo;). But how many people, before Dickens, had
        ever noticed such things? A sympathetic attitude towards children was a much
        rarer thing in Dickens&rsquo;s day than it is now. The early nineteenth century was
        not a good time to be a child. In Dickens&rsquo;s youth children were still being
        &ldquo;solemnly tried at a criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen,&rdquo; and it
        was not so long since boys of thirteen had been hanged for petty theft. The
        doctrine of &ldquo;breaking the child&rsquo;s spirit&rdquo; was in full vigour, and <i>The Fairchild Family</i> was a standard book for children till late into the century. This evil
        book is now issued in pretty-pretty expurgated editions, but it is well worth
        reading in the original version. It gives one some idea of the lengths to which
        child-discipline was sometimes carried. Mr. Fairchild, for instance, when he
        catches his children quarrelling, first thrashes them, reciting Dr. Watts&rsquo;s
        &ldquo;Let dogs delight to bark and bite&rdquo; between blows of the cane, and then takes
        them to spend the afternoon beneath a gibbet where the rotting corpse of a
        murderer is hanging. In the earlier part of the century scores of thousands of
        children, aged sometimes as young as six, were literally worked to death in the
        mines or cotton mills, and even at the fashionable public schools boys were
        flogged till they ran with blood for a mistake in their Latin verses. One thing
        which Dickens seems to have recognized, and which most of his contemporaries
        did not, is the sadistic sexual element in flogging. I think this can be
        inferred from <i>David Copperfield</i> and <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>. But mental cruelty to a
        child infuriates him as much as physical, and though there is a fair number of
        exceptions, his schoolmasters are generally scoundrels.</p>
        <p>Except for the universities and the big public schools, every kind of
        education then existing in England gets a mauling at Dickens&rsquo;s hands. There is
        Doctor Blimber&rsquo;s Academy, where little boys are blown up with Greek until they
        burst, and the revolting charity schools of the period, which produced
        specimens like Noah Claypole and Uriah Heep, and Salem House, and Dotheboys
        Hall, and the disgraceful little dame-school kept by Mr. Wopsle&rsquo;s great-aunt.
        Some of what Dickens says remains true even today. Salem House is the ancestor
        of the modern &ldquo;prep school,&rdquo; which still has a good deal of resemblance to it;
        and as for Mr. Wopsle&rsquo;s great-aunt, some old fraud of much the same stamp is
        carrying on at this moment in nearly every small town in England. But, as
        usual, Dickens&rsquo;s criticism is neither creative nor destructive. He sees the
        idiocy of an educational system founded on the Greek lexicon and the wax-ended
        cane; on the other hand, he has no use for the new kind of school that is
        coming up in the fifties and sixties, the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; school, with its gritty
        insistence on &ldquo;facts.&rdquo; What, then, <i>does</i> he want? As always, what he appears to
        want is a moralized version of the existing thing&ndash;the old type of school,
        but with no caning, no bullying or underfeeding, and not quite so much Greek.
        Doctor Strong&rsquo;s school, to which David Copperfield goes after he escapes from
        Murdstone &amp; Grinby&rsquo;s, is simply Salem House with the vices left out and a
        good deal of &ldquo;old grey stones&rdquo; atmosphere thrown in:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          Doctor Strong&rsquo;s was an excellent school, as different from Mr. Creakle&rsquo;s as
          good is from evil. It was very gravely and decorously ordered, and on a sound
          system; with an appeal, in everything, to the honour and good faith of the
          boys&hellip;which worked wonders. We all felt that we had a part in the management
          of the place, and in sustaining its character and dignity. Hence, we soon
          became warmly attached to it&ndash;I am sure I did for one, and I never knew,
          in all my time, of any boy being otherwise&ndash;and learnt with a good will,
          desiring to do it credit. We had noble games out of hours, and plenty of
          liberty; but even then, as I remember, we were well spoken of in the town, and
          rarely did any disgrace, by our appearance or manner, to the reputation of
          Doctor Strong and Doctor Strong&rsquo;s boys.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the woolly vagueness of this passage one can see Dickens&rsquo;s utter lack of
        any educational theory. He can imagine the <i>moral</i> atmosphere of a good school,
        but nothing further. The boys &ldquo;learnt with a good will,&rdquo; but what did they
        learn? No doubt it was Doctor Blimber&rsquo;s curriculum, a little watered down.
        Considering the attitude to society that is everywhere implied in Dickens&rsquo;s
        novels, it comes as rather a shock to learn that he sent his eldest son to Eton
        and sent all his children through the ordinary educational mill. Gissing seems
        to think that he may have done this because he was painfully conscious of being
        under-educated himself. Here perhaps Gissing is influenced by his own love of
        classical learning. Dickens had had little or no formal education, but he lost
        nothing by missing it, and on the whole he seems to have been aware of this. If
        he was unable to imagine a better school than Doctor Strong&rsquo;s, or, in real
        life, than Eton, it was probably due to an intellectual deficiency rather
        different from the one Gissing suggests.</p>
        <p>It seems that in every attack Dickens makes upon society he is always
        pointing to a change of spirit rather than a change of structure. It is
        hopeless to try and pin him down to any definite remedy, still more to any
        political doctrine. His approach is always along the moral plane, and his
        attitude is sufficiently summed up in that remark about Strong&rsquo;s school being
        as different from Creakle&rsquo;s &ldquo;as good is from evil.&rdquo; Two things can be very much
        alike and yet abysmally different. Heaven and Hell are in the same place.
        Useless to change institutions without a &ldquo;change of heart&rdquo;&ndash;that,
        essentially, is what he is always saying.</p>
        <p>If that were all, he might be no more than a cheer-up writer, a reactionary
        humbug. A &ldquo;change of heart&rdquo; is in fact <i>the</i> alibi of people who do not wish to
        endanger the <i>status quo</i>. But Dickens is not a humbug, except in minor matters,
        and the strongest single impression one carries away from his books is that of
        a hatred of tyranny. I said earlier that Dickens is not <i>in the accepted sense</i> a
        revolutionary writer. But it is not at all certain that a merely moral
        criticism of society may not be just as &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo;&ndash;and revolution,
        after all, means turning things upside down&ndash;as the politico-economic
        criticism which is fashionable at this moment. Blake was not a politician, but
        there is more understanding of the nature of capitalist society in a poem like
        &ldquo;I wander through each charted street&rdquo; than in three-quarters of Socialist
        literature. Progress is not an illusion, it happens, but it is slow and
        invariably disappointing. There is always a new tyrant waiting to take over
        from the old&ndash;generally not quite so bad, but still a tyrant. Consequently
        two viewpoints are always tenable. The one, how can you improve human nature
        until you have changed the system? The other, what is the use of changing the
        system before you have improved human nature? They appeal to different
        individuals, and they probably show a tendency to alternate in point of time.
        The moralist and the revolutionary are constantly undermining one another. Marx
        exploded a hundred tons of dynamite beneath the moralist position, and we are
        still living in the echo of that tremendous crash. But already, somewhere or
        other, the sappers are at work and fresh dynamite is being tamped in place to
        blow Marx at the moon. Then Marx, or somebody like him, will come back with yet
        more dynamite, and so the process continues, to an end we cannot yet foresee.
        The central problem&ndash;how to prevent power from being abused&ndash;remains
        unsolved. Dickens, who had not the vision to see that private property is an
        obstructive nuisance, had the vision to see that. &ldquo;If men would behave decently
        the world would be decent&rdquo; is not such a platitude as it sounds.</p>
        <h1 class="chapter-marker">II</h1>
        <p>More completely than most writers, perhaps, Dickens can be explained in
        terms of his social origin, though actually his family history was not quite
        what one would infer from his novels. His father was a clerk in government
        service, and through his mother&rsquo;s family he had connexions with both the Army
        and the Navy. But from the age of nine onwards he was brought up in London in
        commercial surroundings, and generally in an atmosphere of struggling poverty.
        Mentally he belongs to the small urban bourgeoisie, and he happens to be an
        exceptionally fine specimen of this class, with all the &ldquo;points,&rdquo; as it were,
        very highly developed. That is partly what makes him so interesting. If one
        wants a modern equivalent, the nearest would be H. G. Wells, who has had a
        rather similar history and who obviously owes something to Dickens as novelist.
        Arnold Bennett was essentially of the same type, but, unlike the other two, he
        was a midlander, with an industrial and noncomformist rather than commercial
        and Anglican background.</p>
        <p>The great disadvantage, and advantage, of the small urban bourgeois is his
        limited outlook. He sees the world as a middle-class world, and everything
        outside these limits is either laughable or slightly wicked. On the one hand,
        he has no contact with industry or the soil; on the other, no contact with the
        governing classes. Anyone who has studied Wells&rsquo;s novels in detail will have
        noticed that though he hates the aristocrat like poison, he has no particular
        objection to the plutocrat, and no enthusiasm for the proletarian. His most
        hated types, the people he believes to be responsible for all human ills, are
        kings, landowners, priests, nationalists, soldiers, scholars and peasants. At
        first sight a list beginning with kings and ending with peasants looks like a
        mere omnium gatherum, but in reality all these people have a common factor. All
        of them are archaic types, people who are governed by tradition and whose eyes
        are turned towards the past&ndash;the opposite, therefore, of the rising
        bourgeois who has put his money on the future and sees the past simply as a
        dead hand.</p>
        <p>Actually, although Dickens lived in a period when the bourgeoisie was really
        a rising class, he displays this characteristic less strongly than Wells. He is
        almost unconscious of the future and has a rather sloppy love of the
        picturesque (the &ldquo;quaint old church,&rdquo; etc.). Nevertheless his list of most
        hated types is like enough to Wells&rsquo;s for the similarity to be striking. He is
        vaguely on the side of the working class&ndash;has a sort of generalized
        sympathy with them because they are oppressed&ndash;but he does not in reality
        know much about them; they come into his books chiefly as servants, and comic
        servants at that. At the other end of the scale he loathes the aristocrat
        and&ndash;going one better than Wells in this loathes the big bourgeois as
        well. His real sympathies are bounded by Mr. Pickwick on the upper side and Mr.
        Barkis on the lower. But the term &ldquo;aristocrat,&rdquo; for the type Dickens hates, is
        vague and needs defining.</p>
        <p>Actually Dickens&rsquo;s target is not so much the great aristocracy, who hardly
        enter into his books, as their petty offshoots, the cadging dowagers who live
        up mews in Mayfair, and the bureaucrats and professional soldiers. All through
        his books there are countess hostile sketches of these people, and hardly any
        that are friendly. There are practically no friendly pictures of the landowning
        class, for instance. One might make a doubtful exception of Sir Leicester
        Dedlock; otherwise there is only Mr. Wardle (who is a stock figure the &ldquo;good
        old squire&rdquo;) and Haredale in <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>, who has Dickens&rsquo;s sympathy because
        he is a persecuted Catholic. There are no friendly pictures of soldiers (i.e.
        officers), and none at all of naval men. As for his bureaucrats, judges and
        magistrates, most of them would feel quite at home in the Circumlocution
        Office. The only officials whom Dickens handles with any kind of friendliness
        are, significantly enough, policemen.</p>
        <p>Dickens&rsquo;s attitude is easily intelligible to an Englishman, because it is
        part of the English puritan tradition, which is not dead even at this day. The
        class Dickens belonged to, at least by adoption, was growing suddenly rich
        after a couple of centuries of obscurity. It had grown up mainly in the big
        towns, out of contact with agriculture, and politically impotent; government,
        in its experience, was something which either interfered or persecuted.
        Consequently it was a class with no tradition of public service and not much
        tradition of usefulness. What now strikes us as remarkable about the new
        moneyed class of the nineteenth century is their complete irresponsibility;
        they see everything in terms of individual success, with hardly any
        consciousness that the community exists. On the other hand, a Tite Barnacle,
        even when he was neglecting his duties, would have some vague notion of what
        duties he was neglecting. Dickens&rsquo;s attitude is never irresponsible, still less
        does he take the money-grubbing Smilesian line; but at the back of his mind
        there is usually a half-belief that the whole apparatus of government is
        unnecessary. Parliament is simply Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle, the Empire
        is simply Major Bagstock and his Indian servant, the Army is simply Colonel
        Chowser and Doctor Slammer, the public services are simply Bumble and the
        Circumlocution Office&ndash;and so on and so forth. What he does not see, or
        only intermittently sees, is that Coodle and Doodle and all the other corpses
        left over from the eighteenth century <i>are</i> performing a function which neither
        Pickwick nor Boffin would ever bother about.</p>
        <p>And of course this narrowness of vision is in one way a great advantage to
        him, because it is fatal for a caricaturist to see too much. From Dickens&rsquo;s
        point of view &ldquo;good&rdquo; society is simply a collection of village idiots. What a
        crew! Lady Tippins! Mrs. Gowan! Lord Verisopht! The Honourable Bob Stables!
        Mrs. Sparsit (whose husband was a Powler)! The Tite Barnacles! Nupkins! It is
        practically a case-book in lunacy. But at the same time his remoteness from the
        landowning-military-bureaucratic class incapacitates him for full-length
        satire. He only succeeds with this class when he depicts them as mental
        defectives. The accusation which used to be made against Dickens in his
        lifetime, that he &ldquo;could not paint a gentleman,&rdquo; was an absurdity, but it is
        true in this sense, that what he says against the &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; class is seldom
        very damaging. Sir Mulberry Hawk, for instance, is a wretched attempt at the
        wicked-baronet type. Harthouse in <i>Hard Times</i> is better, but he would be only an
        ordinary achievement for Trollope or Thackeray. Trollope&rsquo;s thoughts hardly move
        outside the &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; class, but Thackeray has the great advantage of having
        a foot in two moral camps. In some ways his outlook is very similar to
        Dickens&rsquo;s. Like Dickens, he identifies with the puritanical moneyed class
        against the card-playing, debt-bilking aristocracy. The eighteenth century, as
        he sees it, is sticking out into the nineteenth in the person of the wicked
        Lord Steyne. <i>Vanity Fair</i> is a full-length version of what Dickens did for a few
        chapters in <i>Little Dorrit</i>. But by origins and upbringing Thackeray happens to
        be somewhat nearer to the class he is satirizing. Consequently he can produce
        such comparatively subtle types as, for instance, Major Pendennis and Rawdon
        Crawley. Major Pendennis is a shallow old snob, and Rawdon Crawley is a
        thick-headed ruffian who sees nothing wrong in living for years by swindling
        tradesmen; but what Thackery realizes is that according to their tortuous code
        they are neither of them bad men. Major Pendennis would not sign a dud cheque,
        for instance; Rawdon certainly would, but on the other hand he would not desert
        a friend in a tight corner. Both of them would behave well on the field of
        battle&ndash;a thing that would not particularly appeal to Dickens. The result
        is that at the end one is left with a kind of amused tolerance for Major
        Pendennis and with something approaching respect for Rawdon; and yet one sees,
        better than any diatribe could make one, the utter rottenness of that kind of
        cadging, toadying life on the fringes of smart society. Dickens would be quite
        incapable of this. In his hands both Rawdon and the Major would dwindle to
        traditional caricatures. And, on the whole, his attacks on &ldquo;good&rdquo; society are
        rather perfunctory. The aristocracy and the big bourgeoisie exist in his books
        chiefly as a kind of &ldquo;noises off,&rdquo; a haw-hawing chorus somewhere in the wings,
        like Podsnap&rsquo;s dinner-parties. When he produces a really subtle and damaging
        portrait, like John Dorrit or Harold Skimpole, it is generally of some rather
        middling, unimportant person.</p>
        <p>One very striking thing about Dickens, especially considering the time he
        lived in, is his lack of vulgar nationalism. All peoples who have reached the
        point of becoming nations tend to despise foreigners, but there is not much
        doubt that the English-speaking races are the worst offenders. One can see this
        from the fact that as soon as they become fully aware of any foreign race they
        invent an insulting nickname for it. Wop, Dago, Froggy, Squarehead, Kike,
        Sheeny, Nigger, Wog, Chink, Greaser, Yellowbelly&ndash;these are merely a
        selection. Any time before 1870 the list would have been shorter, because the
        map of the world was different from what it is now, and there were only three
        or four foreign races that had fully entered into the English consciousness.
        But towards these, and especially towards France, the nearest and best-hated
        nation, the English attitude of patronage was so intolerable that English
        &ldquo;arrogance&rdquo; and &ldquo;xenophobia&rdquo; are still a legend. And of course they are not a
        completely untrue legend even now. Till very recently nearly all English
        children were brought up to despise the southern European races, and history as
        taught in schools was mainly a list of battles won by England. But one has got
        to read, say, the <i>Quarterly Review</i> of the thirties to know what boasting really
        is. Those were the days when the English built up their legend of themselves as
        &ldquo;sturdy islanders&rdquo; and &ldquo;stubborn hearts of oak&rdquo; and when it was accepted as a
        kind of scientific fact that one Englishman was the equal of three foreigners.
        All through nineteenth-century novels and comic papers there runs the
        traditional figure of the &ldquo;Froggy&rdquo;&ndash;a small ridiculous man with a tiny
        beard and a pointed top-hat, always jabbering and gesticulating, vain,
        frivolous and fond of boasting of his martial exploits, but generally taking to
        flight when real danger appears. Over against him was John Bull, the &ldquo;sturdy
        English yeoman,&rdquo; or (a more public-school version) the &ldquo;strong, silent
        Englishman&rdquo; of Charles Kingsley, Tom Hughes and others.</p>
        <p>Thackeray, for instance, has this outlook very strongly, though there are
        moments when he sees through it and laughs at it. The one historical fact that
        is firmly fixed in his mind is that the English won the battle of Waterloo. One
        never reads far in his books without coming upon some reference to it. The
        English, as he sees it, are invincible because of their tremendous physical
        strength, due mainly to living on beef. Like most Englishmen of his time, he
        has the curious illusion that the English are larger than other people
        (Thackeray, as it happened, was larger than most people), and therefore he is
        capable of writing passages like this:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          I say to you that you are better than a Frenchman. I would lay even money
          that you who are reading this are more than five feet seven in height, and
          weigh eleven stone; while a Frenchman is five feet four and does not weigh
          nine. The Frenchman has after his soup a dish of vegetables, where you have one
          of meat. You are a different and superior animal&ndash;a French-beating animal
          (the history of hundreds of years has shown you to be so), etc. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are similar passages scattered all through Thackeray&rsquo;s works. Dickens
        would never be guilty of anything of that kind. It would be an exaggeration to
        say that he nowhere pokes fun at foreigners, and of course like nearly all
        nineteenth-century Englishmen, he is untouched by European culture. But never
        anywhere does he indulge in the typical English boasting, the &ldquo;island race,&rdquo;
        &ldquo;bulldog breed,&rdquo; &ldquo;right little, tight little island&rdquo; style of talk. In the
        whole of <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> there is not a line that could be taken as
        meaning, &ldquo;Look how these wicked Frenchmen behave!&rdquo; The only place where he
        seems to display a normal hatred of foreigners is in the American chapters of
        <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>. This, however, is simply the reaction of a generous mind
        against cant. If Dickens were alive today he would make a trip to Soviet Russia
        and come back to the book rather like Gide&rsquo;s <i>Retour de L&rsquo;Urss</i>. But he is
        remarkably free from the idiocy of regarding nations as individuals. He seldom
        even makes jokes turning on nationality. He does not exploit the comic Irishman
        and the comic Welshman, for instance, and not because he objects to stock
        characters and ready-made jokes, which obviously he does not. It is perhaps
        more significant that he shows no prejudice against Jews. It is true that he
        takes it for granted (<i>Oliver Twist</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i>) that a receiver of
        stolen goods will be a Jew, which at the time was probably justified. But the
        &ldquo;Jew joke,&rdquo; endemic in English literature until the rise of Hitler, does not
        appear in his books, and in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> he makes a pious though not very
        convincing attempt to stand up for the Jews.</p>
        <p>Dickens&rsquo;s lack of vulgar nationalism is in part the mark of a real largeness
        of mind, and in part results from his negative, rather unhelpful political
        attitude. He is very much an Englishman but he is hardly aware of
        it&ndash;certainly the thought of being an Englishman does not thrill him. He
        has no imperialist feelings, no discernible views on foreign politics, and is
        untouched by the military tradition. Temperamentally he is much nearer to the
        small noncomformist tradesman who looks down on the &ldquo;redcoats,&rdquo; and thinks that
        war is wicked&ndash;a one-eyed view, but after all, war is wicked. It is
        noticeable that Dickens hardly writes of war, even to denounce it. With all his
        marvellous powers of description, and of describing things he had never seen,
        he never describes a battle, unless one counts the attack on the Bastille in 
        <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>. Probably the subject would not strike him as interesting,
        and in any case he would not regard a battlefield as a place where anything
        worth settling could be settled. It is one up to the lower-middle-class,
        puritan mentality.</p>
        <h1 class="chapter-marker">III</h1>
        <p>Dickens had grown up near enough to poverty to be terrified of it, and in
        spite of his generosity of mind, he is not free from the special prejudices of
        the shabby-genteel. It is usual to claim him as a &ldquo;popular&rdquo; writer, a champion
        of the &ldquo;oppressed masses.&rdquo; So he is, so long as he thinks of them as oppressed;
        but there are two things that condition his attitude. In the first place, he is
        a south-of-England man, and a Cockney at that, and therefore out of touch with
        the bulk of the real oppressed masses, the industrial and agricultural
        labourers. It is interesting to see how Chesterton, another Cockney, always
        presents Dickens as the spokesman of &ldquo;the poor,&rdquo; without showing much awareness
        of who &ldquo;the poor&rdquo; really are. To Chesterton &ldquo;the poor&rdquo; means small shopkeepers
        and servants. Sam Weller, he says, &ldquo;is the great symbol in English literature
        of the populace peculiar to England;&rdquo; and Sam Weller is a valet! The other
        point is that Dickens&rsquo;s early experiences have given him a horror of
        proletarian roughness. He shows this unmistakably whenever he writes of the
        very poorest of the poor, the slum-dwellers. His descriptions of the London
        slums are always full of undisguised repulsion:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          The ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched; and people
          half naked, drunken, slipshod and ugly. Alleys and archways, like so many
          cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the
          straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, and filth, and
          misery, etc. etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are many similar passages in Dickens. From them one gets the
        impression of whole submerged populations whom he regards as being beyond the
        pale. In rather the same way the modern doctrinaire Socialist contemptuously
        writes off a large block of the population as &ldquo;lumpenproletariat.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Dickens also shows less understanding of criminals than one would expect of
        him. Although he is well aware of the social and economic causes of crime, he
        often seems to feel that when a man has once broken the law he has put himself
        outside human society. There is a chapter at the end of <i>David Copperfield</i> in
        which David visits the prison where Latimer and Uriah Heep are serving their
        sentences. Dickens actually seems to regard the horrible &ldquo;model&rdquo; prisons,
        against which Charles Reade delivered his memorable attack in <i>It is Never Too Late to Mend</i>,
        as too humane. He complains that the food is too good! As soon as
        he comes up against crime or the worst depths of poverty, he shows traces of
        the &ldquo;I've always kept myself respectable&rdquo; habit of mind. The attitude of Pip
        (obviously the attitude of Dickens himself) towards Magwitch in <i>Great
        Expectations</i> is extremely interesting. Pip is conscious all along of his
        ingratitude towards Joe, but far less so of his ingratitude towards Magwitch.
        When he discovers that the person who has loaded him with benefits for years is
        actually a transported convict, he falls into frenzies of disgust. &ldquo;The
        abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the repugnance with
        which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded if he had been some
        terrible beast,&rdquo; etc. etc. So far as one can discover from the text, this is
        not because when Pip was a child he had been terrorized by Magwitch in the
        churchyard; it is because Magwitch is a criminal and a convict. There is an
        even more &ldquo;kept-myself-respectable&rdquo; touch in the fact that Pip feels as a
        matter of course that he cannot take Magwitch&rsquo;s money. The money is not the
        product of a crime, it has been honestly acquired; but it is an ex-convict&rsquo;s
        money and therefore &ldquo;tainted.&rdquo; There is nothing psychologically false in this,
        either. Psychologically the latter part of <i>Great Expectations</i> is about the best
        thing Dickens ever did; throughout this part of the book one feels &ldquo;Yes, that
        is just how Pip would have behaved.&rdquo; But the point is that in the matter of
        Magwitch, Dickens identifies with Pip, and his attitude is at bottom snobbish.
        The result is that Magwitch belongs to the same queer class of characters as
        Falstaff and, probably, Don Quixote&ndash;characters who are more pathetic than
        the author intended.</p>
        <p>When it is a question of the non-criminal poor, the ordinary, decent,
        labouring poor, there is of course nothing contemptuous in Dickens&rsquo;s attitude.
        He has the sincerest admiration for people like the Peggottys and the
        Plornishes. But it is questionable whether he really regards them as equals. It
        is of the greatest interest to read Chapter XI of <i>David Copperfield</i> and side by
        side with it the autobiographical fragments (parts of this are given in
        Forster&rsquo;s <i>Life</i>), in which Dickens expresses his feelings about the
        blacking-factory episode a great deal more strongly than in the novel. For more
        than twenty years afterwards the memory was so painful to him that he would go
        out of his way to avoid that part of the Strand. He says that to pass that way
        &ldquo;made me cry, after my eldest child could speak.&rdquo; The text makes it quite clear
        that what hurt him most of all, then and in retrospect, was the enforced
        contact with &ldquo;low&rdquo; associates:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          No words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into this
          companionship; compared these everyday associates with those of my happier
          childhood. But I held some station at the blacking warehouse too&hellip;I soon
          became at least as expeditious and as skilful with my hands as either of the
          other boys. Though perfectly familiar with them, my conduct and manners were
          different enough from theirs to place a space between us. They, and the men,
          always spoke of me as &ldquo;the young gentleman.&rdquo; A certain man&hellip;used to call me
          &ldquo;Charles&rdquo; sometimes in speaking to me; but I think it was mostly when we were
          very confidential&hellip;Poll Green uprose once, and rebelled against the
          &ldquo;young-gentleman&rdquo; usage; but Bob Fagin settled him speedily.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It was as well that there should be &ldquo;a space between us,&rdquo; you see. However
        much Dickens may admire the working classes, he does not wish to resemble them.
        Given his origins, and the time he lived in, it could hardly be otherwise. In
        the early nineteenth century class animosities may have been no sharper than
        they are now, but the surface differences between class and class were
        enormously greater. The &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; and the &ldquo;common man&rdquo; must have seemed like
        different species of animal. Dickens is quite genuinely on the side of the poor
        against the rich, but it would be next door to impossible for him not to think
        of a working-class exterior as a stigma. In one of Tolstoy&rsquo;s fables the
        peasants of a certain village judge every stranger who arrives from the state
        of his hands. If his palms are hard from work, they let him in; if his palms
        are soft, out he goes. This would be hardly intelligible to Dickens; all his
        heroes have soft hands. His younger heroes&ndash;Nicholas Nickleby, Martin
        Chuzzlewit, Edward Chester, David Copperfield, John Harmon&ndash;are usually of
        the type known as &ldquo;walking gentlemen.&rdquo; He likes a bourgeois exterior and a
        bourgeois (not aristocratic) accent. One curious symptom of this is that he
        will not allow anyone who is to play a heroic part to speak like a working man.
        A comic hero like Sam Weller, or a merely pathetic figure like Stephen
        Blackpool, can speak with a broad accent, but the <i>Jeune Premier</i> always speaks
        the equivalent of B.B.C. This is so, even when it involves absurdities. Little
        Pip, for instance, is brought up by people speaking broad Essex, but talks
        upper-class English from his earliest childhood; actually he would have talked
        the same dialect as Joe, or at least as Mrs. Gargery. So also with Biddy
        Wopsle, Lizzie Hexam, Sissie Jupe, Oliver Twist&ndash;one ought perhaps to add
        Little Dorrit. Even Rachel in <i>Hard Times</i> has barely a trace of Lancashire
        accent, an impossibility in her case.</p>
        <p>One thing that often gives the clue to a novelist&rsquo;s real feelings on the
        class question is the attitude he takes up when class collides with sex. This
        is a thing too painful to be lied about, and consequently it is one of the
        points at which the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m-not-a-snob&rdquo; pose tends to break down.</p>
        <p>One sees that at its most obvious where a class-distinction is also a
        colour-distinction. And something resembling the colonial attitude (&ldquo;native&rdquo;
        women are fair game, white women are sacrosanct) exists in a veiled form in
        all-white communities, causing bitter resentment on both sides. When this issue
        arises, novelists often revert to crude class-feelings which they might
        disclaim at other times. A good example of &ldquo;class-conscious&rdquo; reaction is a
        rather forgotten novel, <i>The People of Clopton</i>, by Andrew Barton. The author&rsquo;s
        moral code is quite clearly mixed up with class-hatred. He feels the seduction
        of a poor girl by a rich man to be something atrocious, a kind of defilement,
        something quite different from her seduction by a man in her own walk of life.
        Trollope deals with this theme twice (<i>The Three Clerks</i> and <i>The Small House at Allington</i>) and, as one might expect, entirely from the upper-class angle. As he
        sees it, an affair with a barmaid or a landlady&rsquo;s daughter is simply an
        &ldquo;entanglement&rdquo; to be escaped from. Trollope&rsquo;s moral standards are strict, and
        he does not allow the seduction actually to happen, but the implication is
        always that a working-class girl&rsquo;s feelings do not greatly matter. In <i>The Three Clerks</i>
        he even gives the typical class-reaction by noting that the girl
        &ldquo;smells.&rdquo; Meredith (<i>Rhode Fleming</i>) takes more the &ldquo;class-conscious&rdquo; viewpoint.
        Thackeray, as often, seems to hesitate. In <i>Pendennis</i> (Fanny Bolton) his
        attitude is much the same as Trollope&rsquo;s; in <i>A Shabby Genteel Story</i> it is nearer
        to Meredith&rdquo;s.</p>
        <p>One could divine a great deal about Trollope&rsquo;s social origin, or Meredith&rsquo;s,
        or Barton&rsquo;s, merely from their handling of the class-sex theme. So one can with
        Dickens, but what emerges, as usual, is that he is more inclined to identify
        himself with the middle class than with the proletariat. The one incident that
        seems to contradict this is the tale of the young peasant-girl in Doctor
        Manette&rsquo;s manuscript in <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>. This, however, is merely a
        costume-piece put in to explain the implacable hatred of Madame Defarge, which
        Dickens does not pretend to approve of. In <i>David Copperfield</i>, where he is
        dealing with a typical nineteenth-century seduction, the class-issue does not
        seem to strike him as paramount. It is a law of Victorian novels that sexual
        misdeeds must not go unpunished, and so Steerforth is drowned on Yarmouth
        sands, but neither Dickens, nor old Peggotty, nor even Ham, seems to feel that
        Steerforth has added to his offence by being the son of rich parents. The
        Steerforths are moved by class-motives, but the Peggottys are not&ndash;not
        even in the scene between Mrs. Steerforth and old Peggotty; if they were, of
        course, they would probably turn against David as well as against
        Steerforth.</p>
        <p>In <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> Dickens treats the episode of Eugene Wrayburn and
        Lizzie Hexam very realistically and with no appearance of class bias. According
        to the &ldquo;Unhand me, monster!&rdquo; tradition, Lizzie ought either to &ldquo;spurn&rdquo; Eugene
        or to be ruined by him and throw herself off Waterloo Bridge: Eugene ought to
        be either a heartless betrayer or a hero resolved upon defying society. Neither
        behaves in the least like this. Lizzie is frightened by Eugene&rsquo;s advances and
        actually runs away from him, but hardly pretends to dislike them; Eugene is
        attracted by her, has too much decency to attempt seducing her and dare not
        marry her because of his family. Finally they are married and no one is any the
        worse, except Mrs. Twemlow, who will lose a few dinner engagements. It is all
        very much as it might have happened in real life. But a &ldquo;class-conscious&rdquo;
        novelist would have given her to Bradley Headstone.</p>
        <p>But when it is the other way about&ndash;when it is a case of a poor man
        aspiring to some woman who is &ldquo;above&rdquo; him Dickens instantly retreats into the
        middle-class attitude. He is rather fond of the Victorian notion of a woman
        (woman with a capital W) being &ldquo;above&rdquo; a man. Pip feels that Estella is &ldquo;above&rdquo;
        him, Esther Summerson is &ldquo;above&rdquo; Guppy, Little Dorrit is &ldquo;above&rdquo; John Chivery,
        Lucy Manette is &ldquo;above&rdquo; Sydney Carton. In some of these the &ldquo;above&rdquo;-ness is
        merely moral, but in others it is social. There is a scarcely mistakable
        class-reaction when David Copperfield discovers that Uriah Heep is plotting to
        marry Agnes Wickfield. The disgusting Uriah suddenly announces that he is in
        love with her:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          &ldquo;Oh, Master Copperfield, with what a pure affection do I love the ground my
          Agnes walks on.&rdquo;
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I believe I had the delirious idea of seizing the red-hot poker out of the
        fire, and running him through with it. It went from me with a shock, like a
        ball fired from a rifle: but the image of Agnes, outraged by so much as a
        thought of this red-headed animal&rsquo;s, remained in my mind (when I looked at him,
        sitting all awry as if his mean soul griped his body) and made me giddy&hellip;&ldquo;I
        believe Agnes Wickfield to be as far above you&rdquo; (David says later on), and as
        far removed from all your aspirations, as the moon herself.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Considering how Heep&rsquo;s general lowness&ndash;his servile manners, dropped
        aitches and so forth&ndash;has been rubbed in throughout the book, there is not
        much doubt about the nature of Dickens&rsquo;s feelings. Heep, of course, is playing
        a villainous part, but even villains have sexual lives; it is the thought of
        the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Agnes in bed with a man who drops his aitches that really revolts
        Dickens. But his usual tendency is to treat a man in love with a woman who is
        &ldquo;above&rdquo; him as a joke. It is one of the stock jokes of English literature, from
        Malvolio onwards. Guppy in <i>Bleak House</i> is an example, John Chivery is another,
        and there is a rather ill-natured treatment of this theme in the &ldquo;swarry&rdquo; in
        <i>Pickwick Papers</i>. Here Dickens describes the Bath footmen as living a kind of
        fantasy-life, holding dinner-parties in imitation of their &ldquo;betters&rdquo; and
        deluding themselves that their young mistresses are in love with them. This
        evidently strikes him as very comic. So it is in a way, though one might
        question whether it is not better for a footman even to have delusions of this
        kind than simply to accept his status in the spirit of the catechism.</p>
        <p>In his attitude towards servants Dickens is not ahead of his age. In the
        nineteenth century the revolt against domestic service was just beginning, to
        the great annoyance of everyone with over &pound;500 a year. An enormous number
        of the jokes in nineteenth-century comic papers deals with the uppishness of
        servants. For years <i>Punch</i> ran a series of jokes called &ldquo;Servant Gal-isms,&rdquo; all
        turning on the then astonishing fact that a servant is a human being. Dickens
        is sometimes guilty of this kind of thing himself. His books abound with the
        ordinary comic servants; they are dishonest (<i>Great Expectations</i>), incompetent
        (<i>David Copperfield</i>), turn up their noses at good food (<i>Pickwick Papers</i>), etc.
        etc.&ndash;all rather in the spirit of the suburban housewife with one
        downtrodden cook-general. But what is curious, in a nineteenth-century radical,
        is that when he wants to draw a sympathetic picture of a servant, he creates
        what is recognizably a feudal type. Sam Weller, Mark Tapley, Clara Peggotty are
        all of them feudal figures. They belong to the genre of the &ldquo;old family
        retainer;&rdquo; they identify themselves with their master&rsquo;s family and are at once
        doggishly faithful and completely familiar. No doubt Mark Tapley and Sam Weller
        are derived to some extent from Smollett, and hence from Cervantes; but it is
        interesting that Dickens should have been attracted by such a type. Sam
        Weller&rsquo;s attitude is definitely medieval. He gets himself arrested in order to
        follow Mr. Pickwick into the Fleet, and afterwards refuses to get married
        because he feels that Mr. Pickwick still needs his services. There is a
        characteristic scene between them:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          <p>&ldquo;Vages or no vages, board or no board, lodgin&rsquo; or no lodgin,&rsquo;&rdquo; Sam Veller, as
          you took from the old inn in the Borough, sticks by you, come what may&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;My good fellow,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, when Mr. Weller had sat down again,
          rather abashed at his own enthusiasm, &ldquo;you are bound to consider the young
          woman also.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I do consider the young 'ooman, sir,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I have considered the
          young 'ooman. I've spoke to her. I've told her how I'm sitivated; she&rsquo;s ready
          to vait till I'm ready, and I believe she vill. If she don't, she&rsquo;s not the
          young 'ooman I take her for, and I give up with readiness.&rdquo;</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is easy to imagine what the young woman would have said to this in real
        life. But notice the feudal atmosphere. Sam Weller is ready as a matter of
        course to sacrifice years of his life to his master, and he can also sit down
        in his master&rsquo;s presence. A modern manservant would never think of doing
        either. Dickens&rsquo;s views on the servant question do not get much beyond wishing
        that master and servant would love one another. Sloppy in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>,
        though a wretched failure as a character, represents the same kind of loyalty
        as Sam Weller. Such loyalty, of course, is natural, human, and likeable; but so
        was feudalism.</p>
        <p>What Dickens seems to be doing, as usual, is to reach out for an idealized
        version of the existing thing. He was writing at a time when domestic service
        must have seemed a completely inevitable evil. There were no labour-saving
        devices, and there was huge inequality of wealth. It was an age of enormous
        families, pretentious meals and inconvenient houses, when the slavey drudging
        fourteen hours a day in the basement kitchen was something too normal to be
        noticed. And given the <i>fact</i> of servitude, the feudal relationship is the only
        tolerable one. Sam Weller and Mark Tapley are dream figures, no less than the
        Cheerybles. If there have got to be masters and servants, how much better that
        the master should be Mr. Pickwick and the servant should be Sam Weller. Better
        still, of course, if servants did not exist at all&ndash;but this Dickens is
        probably unable to imagine. Without a high level of mechanical development,
        human equality is not practically possible; Dickens goes to show that it is not
        imaginable either.</p>
        <h1 class="chapter-marker">IV</h1>
        <p>It is not merely a coincidence that Dickens never writes about agriculture
        and writes endlessly about food. He was a Cockney, and London is the centre of
        the earth in rather the same sense that the belly is the centre of the body. It
        is a city of consumers, of people who are deeply civilized but not primarily
        useful. A thing that strikes one when one looks below the surface of Dickens&rsquo;s
        books is that, as nineteenth-century novelists go, he is rather ignorant. He
        knows very little about the way things really happen. At first sight this
        statement looks flatly untrue and it needs some qualification.</p>
        <p>Dickens had had vivid glimpses of &ldquo;low life&rdquo;&ndash;life in a debtor&rsquo;s
        prison, for example&ndash;and he was also a popular novelist and able to write
        about ordinary people. So were all the characteristic English novelists of the
        nineteenth century. They felt at home in the world they lived in, whereas a
        writer nowadays is so hopelessly isolated that the typical modern novel is a
        novel about a novelist. Even when Joyce, for instance, spends a decade or so in
        patient efforts to make contact with the &ldquo;common man,&rdquo; his &ldquo;common man&rdquo; finally
        turns out to be a Jew, and a bit of a highbrow at that. Dickens at least does
        not suffer from this kind of thing. He has no difficulty in introducing the
        common motives, love, ambition, avarice, vengeance and so forth. What he does
        not noticeably write about, however, is work.</p>
        <p>In Dickens&rsquo;s novels anything in the nature of work happens off-stage. The
        only one of his heroes who has a plausible profession is David Copperfield, who
        is first a shorthand writer and then a novelist, like Dickens himself. With
        most of the others, the way they earn their living is very much in the
        background. Pip, for instance, &ldquo;goes into business&rdquo; in Egypt; we are not told
        what business, and Pip&rsquo;s working life occupies about half a page of the book.
        Clennam has been in some unspecified business in China, and later goes into
        another barely specified business with Doyce; Martin Chuzzlewit is an
        architect, but does not seem to get much time for practising. In no case do
        their adventures spring directly out of their work. Here the contrast between
        Dickens and, say, Trollope is startling. And one reason for this is undoubtedly
        that Dickens knows very little about the professions his characters are
        supposed to follow. What exactly went on in Gradgrind&rsquo;s factories? How did
        Podsnap make his money? How did Merdle work his swindles? One knows that
        Dickens could never follow up the details of Parliamentary elections and Stock
        Exchange rackets as Trollope could. As soon as he has to deal with trade,
        finance, industry or politics he takes refuge in vagueness, or in satire. This
        is the case even with legal processes, about which actually he must have known
        a good deal. Compare any lawsuit in Dickens with the lawsuit in <i>Orley Farm</i>, for
        instance.</p>
        <p>And this partly accounts for the needless ramifications of Dickens&rsquo;s novels,
        the awful Victorian &ldquo;plot.&rdquo; It is true that not all his novels are alike in
        this. <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> is a very good and fairly simple story, and so in
        its different ways is <i>Hard Times</i>; but these are just the two which are always
        rejected as &ldquo;not like Dickens'&ndash;and incidentally they were not published
        in monthly numbers. The two first-person novels are also good stories, apart
        from their subplots. But the typical Dickens novel, <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, <i>Oliver
        Twist</i>, <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>, <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, always exists round a framework of
        melodrama. The last thing anyone ever remembers about the books is their
        central story. On the other hand, I suppose no one has ever read them without
        carrying the memory of individual pages to the day of his death. Dickens sees
        human beings with the most intense vividness, but sees them always in private
        life, as &ldquo;characters,&rdquo; not as functional members of society; that is to say, he
        sees them statically. Consequently his greatest success is The <i>Pickwick Papers</i>,
        which is not a story at all, merely a series of sketches; there is little
        attempt at development&ndash;the characters simply go on and on, behaving like
        idiots, in a kind of eternity. As soon as he tries to bring his characters into
        action, the melodrama begins. He cannot make the action revolve round their
        ordinary occupations; hence the crossword puzzle of coincidences, intrigues,
        murders, disguises, buried wills, long-lost brothers, etc. etc. In the end even
        people like Squeers and Micawber get sucked into the machinery.</p>
        <p>Of course it would be absurd to say that Dickens is a vague or merely
        melodramatic writer. Much that he wrote is extremely factual, and in the power
        of evoking visual images he has probably never been equalled. When Dickens has
        once described something you see it for the rest of your life. But in a way the
        concreteness of his vision is a sign of what he is missing. For, after all,
        that is what the merely casual onlooker always sees&ndash;the outward
        appearance, the non-functional, the surfaces of things. No one who is really
        involved in the landscape ever sees the landscape. Wonderfully as he can
        describe an <i>appearance</i>, Dickens does not often describe a process. The vivid
        pictures that he succeeds in leaving in one&rsquo;s memory are nearly always the
        pictures of things seen in leisure moments, in the coffee-rooms of country inns
        or through the windows of a stage-coach; the kind of things he notices are
        inn-signs, brass door-knockers, painted jugs, the interiors of shops and
        private houses, clothes, faces and, above all, food. Everything is seen from
        the consumer-angle. When he writes about Cokestown he manages to evoke, in just
        a few paragraphs, the atmosphere of a Lancashire town as a slightly disgusted
        southern visitor would see it. &ldquo;It had a black canal in it, and a river that
        ran purple with evil-smelling dye, and vast piles of buildings full of windows
        where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long, where the piston of
        the steam-engine worked monotonously up and down, like the head of an elephant
        in a state of melancholy madness.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>That is as near as Dickens ever gets to the machinery of the mills. An
        engineer or a cotton-broker would see it differently; but then neither of them
        would be capable of that impressionistic touch about the heads of the
        elephants.</p>
        <p>In a rather different sense his attitude to life is extremely unphysical. He
        is a man who lives through his eyes and ears rather than through his hands and
        muscles. Actually his habits were not so sedentary as this seems to imply. In
        spite of rather poor health and physique, he was active to the point of
        restlessness; throughout his life he was a remarkable walker, and he could at
        any rate carpenter well enough to put up stage scenery. But he was not one of
        those people who feel a need to use their hands. It is difficult to imagine him
        digging at a cabbage-patch, for instance. He gives no evidence of knowing
        anything about agriculture, and obviously knows nothing about any kind of game
        or sport. He has no interest in pugilism, for instance. Considering the age in
        which he was writing, it is astonishing how little physical brutality there is
        in Dickens&rsquo;s novels. Martin Chuzzlewit and Mark Tapley, for instance, behave
        with the most remarkable mildness towards the Americans who are constantly
        menacing them with revolvers and bowie-knives. The average English or American
        novelist would have had them handing out socks on the jaw and exchanging
        pistol-shots in all directions. Dickens is too decent for that; he sees the
        stupidity of violence, and he also belongs to a cautious urban class which does
        not deal in socks on the jaw, even in theory. And his attitude towards sport is
        mixed up with social feelings. In England, for mainly geographical reasons,
        sport, especially field-sports, and snobbery are inextricably mingled. English
        Socialists are often flatly incredulous when told that Lenin, for instance, was
        devoted to shooting. In their eyes, shooting, hunting, etc., are simply
        snobbish observances of the landed gentry; they forget that these things might
        appear differently in a huge virgin country like Russia. From Dickens&rsquo;s point
        of view almost any kind of sport is at best a subject for satire. Consequently
        one side of nineteenth-century life&ndash;the boxing, racing, cock-fighting,
        badger-digging, poaching, rat-catching side of life, so wonderfully embalmed in
        Leech&rsquo;s illustrations to Surtees&ndash;is outside his scope.</p>
        <p>What is more striking, in a seemingly &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; radical, is that he is
        not mechanically minded. He shows no interest either in the details of
        machinery or in the things machinery can do. As Gissing remarks, Dickens
        nowhere describes a railway journey with anything like the enthusiasm he shows
        in describing journeys by stage-coach. In nearly all of his books one has a
        curious feeling that one is living in the first quarter of the nineteenth
        century, and in fact, he does tend to return to this period. <i>Little Dorrit</i>,
        written in the middle fifties, deals with the late twenties; <i>Great Expectations</i>
        (1861) is not dated, but evidently deals with the twenties and thirties.
        Several of the inventions and discoveries which have made the modern world
        possible (the electric telegraph, the breech-loading gun, India-rubber, coal
        gas, wood-pulp paper) first appeared in Dickens&rsquo;s lifetime, but he scarcely
        notes them in his books. Nothing is queerer than the vagueness with which he
        speaks of Doyce&rsquo;s &ldquo;invention&rdquo; in <i>Little Dorrit</i>. It is represented as something
        extremely ingenious and revolutionary, &ldquo;of great importance to his country and
        his fellow-creatures,&rdquo; and it is also an important minor link in the book; yet
        we are never told what the &ldquo;invention&rdquo; is! On the other hand, Doyce&rsquo;s physical
        appearance is hit off with the typical Dickens touch; he has a peculiar way of
        moving his thumb, a way characteristic of engineers. After that, Doyce is
        firmly anchored in one&rsquo;s memory; but, as usual, Dickens has done it by
        fastening on something external.</p>
        <p>There are people (Tennyson is an example) who lack the mechanical faculty
        but can see the social possibilities of machinery. Dickens has not this stamp
        of mind. He shows very little consciousness of the future. When he speaks of
        human progress it is usually in terms of <i>moral</i> progress&ndash;men growing
        better; probably he would never admit that men are only as good as their
        technical development allows them to be. At this point the gap between Dickens
        and his modern analogue, H.G. Wells, is at its widest. Wells wears the future
        round his neck like a mill-stone, but Dickens&rsquo;s unscientific cast of mind is
        just as damaging in a different way. What it does is to make any <i>positive</i>
        attitude more difficult for him. He is hostile to the feudal, agricultural past
        and not in real touch with the industrial present. Well, then, all that remains
        is the future (meaning Science, &ldquo;progress,&rdquo; and so forth), which hardly enters
        into his thoughts. Therefore, while attacking everything in sight, he has no
        definable standard of comparison. As I have pointed out already, he attacks the
        current educational system with perfect justice, and yet, after all, he has no
        remedy to offer except kindlier schoolmasters. Why did he not indicate what a
        school <i>might</i> have been? Why did he not have his own sons educated according to
        some plan of his own, instead of sending them to public schools to be stuffed
        with Greek? Because he lacked that kind of imagination. He has an infallible
        moral sense, but very little intellectual curiosity. And here one comes upon
        something which really is an enormous deficiency in Dickens, something, that
        really does make the nineteenth century seem remote from us&ndash;that he has
        no idea of work.</p>
        <p>With the doubtful exception of David Copperfield (merely Dickens himself),
        one cannot point to a single one of his central characters who is primarily
        interested in his job. His heroes work in order to make a living and to marry
        the heroine, not because they feel a passionate interest in one particular
        subject. Martin Chuzzlewit, for instance, is not burning with zeal to be an
        architect; he might just as well be a doctor or a barrister. In any case, in
        the typical Dickens novel, the <i>deus ex machina</i> enters with a bag of gold in the
        last chapter and the hero is absolved from further struggle. The feeling &ldquo;This
        is what I came into the world to do. Everything else is uninteresting. I will
        do this even if it means starvation,&rdquo; which turns men of differing temperaments
        into scientists, inventors, artists, priests, explorers and
        revolutionaries&ndash;this motif is almost entirely absent from Dickens&rsquo;s
        books. He himself, as is well known, worked like a slave and believed in his
        work as few novelists have ever done. But there seems to be no calling except
        novel-writing (and perhaps acting) towards which he can imagine this kind of
        devotion. And, after all, it is natural enough, considering his rather negative
        attitude towards society. In the last resort there is nothing he admires except
        common decency. Science is uninteresting and machinery is cruel and ugly (the
        heads of the elephants). Business is only for ruffians like Bounderby. As for
        politics&ndash;leave that to the Tite Barnacles. Really there is no objective
        except to marry the heroine, settle down, live solvently and be kind. And you
        can do that much better in private life.</p>
        <p>Here, perhaps, one gets a glimpse of Dickens&rsquo;s secret imaginative
        background. What did he think of as the most desirable way to live? When Martin
        Chuzzlewit had made it up with his uncle, when Nicholas Nickleby had married
        money, when John Harman had been enriched by Boffin what did they <i>do</i>?</p>
        <p>The answer evidently is that they did nothing. Nicholas Nickleby invested
        his wife&rsquo;s money with the Cheerybles and &ldquo;became a rich and prosperous
        merchant,&rdquo; but as he immediately retired into Devonshire, we can assume that he
        did not work very hard. Mr. and Mrs. Snodgrass &ldquo;purchased and cultivated a
        small farm, more for occupation than profit.&rdquo; That is the spirit in which most
        of Dickens&rsquo;s books end&ndash;a sort of radiant idleness. Where he appears to
        disapprove of young men who do not work (Harthouse, Harry Gowan, Richard
        Carstone, Wrayburn before his reformation) it is because they are cynical and
        immoral or because they are a burden on somebody else; if you are &ldquo;good,&rdquo; and
        also self-supporting, there is no reason why you should not spend fifty years
        in simply drawing your dividends. Home life is always enough. And, after all,
        it was the general assumption of his age. The &ldquo;genteel sufficiency,&rdquo; the
        &ldquo;competence,&rdquo; the &ldquo;gentleman of independent means&rdquo; (or &ldquo;in easy
        circumstances&rdquo;)&ndash;the very phrases tell one all about the strange, empty
        dream of the eighteenth-  and nineteenth-century middle bourgeoisie. It was a
        dream of <i>complete idleness</i>. Charles Reade conveys its spirit perfectly in the
        ending of <i>Hard Cash</i>. Alfred Hardie, hero of <i>Hard Cash</i>, is the typical
        nineteenth-century novel-hero (public-school style), with gifts which Reade
        describes as amounting to &ldquo;genius.&rdquo; He is an old Etonian and a scholar of
        Oxford, he knows most of the Greek and Latin classics by heart, he can box with
        prizefighters and win the Diamond Sculls at Henley. He goes through incredible
        adventures in which, of course, he behaves with faultless heroism, and then, at
        the age of twenty-five, he inherits a fortune, marries his Julia Dodd and
        settles down in the suburbs of Liverpool, in the same house as his
        parents-in-law:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
        <p>They all lived together at Albion Villa, thanks to Alfred&hellip;Oh, you happy
        little villa! You were as like Paradise as any mortal dwelling can be. A day
        came, however, when your walls could no longer hold all the happy inmates.
        Julia presented Alfred with a lovely boy; enter two nurses and the villa showed
        symptoms of bursting. Two months more, and Alfred and his wife overflowed into
        the next villa. It was but twenty yards off; and there was a double reason for
        the migration. As often happens after a long separation, Heaven bestowed on
        Captain and Mrs. Dodd another infant to play about their knees, etc. etc.
        etc.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is the type of the Victorian happy ending&ndash;a vision of a huge,
        loving family of three or four generations, all crammed together in the same
        house and constantly multiplying, like a bed of oysters. What is striking about
        it is the utterly soft, sheltered, effortless life that it implies. It is not
        even a violent idleness, like Squire Western&rsquo;s.</p>
        <p>That is the significance of Dickens&rsquo;s urban background and his non interest
        in the blackguardly-sporting military side of life. His heroes, once they had
        come into money and &ldquo;settled down,&rdquo; would not only do no work; they would not
        even ride, hunt, shoot, fight duels, elope with actresses or lose money at the
        races. They would simply live at home in feather-bed respectability, and
        preferably next door to a blood-relation living exactly the same life:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          <p>The first act of Nicholas, when he became a rich and prosperous merchant,
          was to buy his father&rsquo;s old house. As time crept on, and there came gradually
          about him a group of lovely children, it was altered and enlarged; but none of
          the old rooms were ever pulled down, no old tree was ever rooted up, nothing
          with which there was any association of bygone times was ever removed or
          changed.</p>
          <p>Within a stone&rsquo;s-throw was another retreat enlivened by children&rsquo;s pleasant
          voices too; and here was Kate&hellip;the same true, gentle creature, the same fond
          sister, the same in the love of all about her, as in her girlish days.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is the same incestuous atmosphere as in the passage quoted from Reade.
        And evidently this is Dickens&rsquo;s ideal ending. It is perfectly attained in
        <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> and <i>Pickwick</i>, and it is approximated to in
        varying degrees in almost all the others. The exceptions are <i>Hard Times</i> and
        <i>Great Expectations</i>&ndash;the latter actually has a &ldquo;happy ending,&rdquo; but it
        contradicts the general tendency of the book, and it was put in at the request
        of Bulwer Lytton.</p>
        <p>The ideal to be striven after, then, appears to be something like this: a
        hundred thousand pounds, a quaint old house with plenty of ivy on it, a sweetly
        womanly wife, a horde of children, and no work. Everything is safe, soft,
        peaceful and, above all, domestic. In the moss-grown churchyard down the road
        are the graves of the loved ones who passed away before the happy ending
        happened. The servants are comic and feudal, the children prattle round your
        feet, the old friends sit at your fireside, talking of past days, there is the
        endless succession of enormous meals, the cold punch and sherry negus, the
        feather beds and warming-pans, the Christmas parties with charades and blind
        man&rsquo;s buff; but nothing ever happens, except the yearly childbirth. The curious
        thing is that it is a genuinely happy picture, or so Dickens is able to make it
        appear. The thought of that kind of existence is satisfying to him. This alone
        would be enough to tell one that more than a hundred years have passed since
        Dickens&rsquo;s first book was written. No modern man could combine such
        purposelessness with so much vitality.</p>
        <h1 class="chapter-marker">V</h1>
        <p>By this time anyone who is a lover of Dickens, and who has read as far as
        this, will probably be angry with me.</p>
        <p>I have been discussing Dickens simply in terms of his &ldquo;message,&rdquo; and almost
        ignoring his literary qualities. But every writer, especially every novelist,
        <i>has</i> a &ldquo;message,&rdquo; whether he admits it or not, and the minutest details of his
        work are influenced by it. All art is propaganda. Neither Dickens himself nor
        the majority of Victorian novelists would have thought of denying this. On the
        other hand, not all propaganda is art. As I said earlier, Dickens is one of
        those writers who are felt to be worth stealing. He has been stolen by
        Marxists, by Catholics and, above all, by Conservatives. The question is, What
        is there to steal? Why does anyone care about Dickens? Why do I care about
        Dickens?</p>
        <p>That kind of question is never easy to answer. As a rule, an aesthetic
        preference is either something inexplicable or it is so corrupted by
        non-aesthetic motives as to make one wonder whether the whole of literary
        criticism is not a huge network of humbug. In Dickens&rsquo;s case the complicating
        factor is his familiarity. He happens to be one of those &ldquo;great authors&rdquo; who
        are ladled down everyone&rsquo;s throat in childhood. At the time this causes
        rebellion and vomiting, but it may have different after-effects in later life.
        For instance, nearly everyone feels a sneaking affection for the patriotic
        poems that he learned by heart as a child, &ldquo;Ye Mariners of England,&rdquo; the
        &ldquo;Charge of the Light Brigade&rdquo; and so forth. What one enjoys is not so much the
        poems themselves as the memories they call up. And with Dickens the same forces
        of association are at work. Probably there are copies of one or two of his
        books lying about in an actual majority of English homes. Many children begin
        to know his characters by sight before they can even read, for on the whole
        Dickens was lucky in his illustrators. A thing that is absorbed as early as
        that does not come up against any critical judgement. And when one thinks of
        this, one thinks of all that is bad and silly in Dickens&ndash;the cast-iron
        &ldquo;plots,&rdquo; the characters who don't come off, the longueurs, the paragraphs in
        blank verse, the awful pages of &ldquo;pathos.&rdquo; And then the thought arises, when I
        say I like Dickens, do I simply mean that I like thinking about my childhood?
        Is Dickens merely an institution?</p>
        <p>If so, he is an institution that there is no getting away from. How often
        one really thinks about any writer, even a writer one cares for, is a difficult
        thing to decide; but I should doubt whether anyone who has actually read
        Dickens can go a week without remembering him in one context or another.
        Whether you approve of him or not, he is <i>there</i>, like the Nelson Column. At any
        moment some scene or character, which may come from some book you cannot even
        remember the name of, is liable to drop into your mind. Micawber&rsquo;s letters!
        Winkle in the witness-box! Mrs. Gamp! Mrs. Wititterly and Sir Tumley Snuffim!
        Todgers&rsquo;s! (George Gissing said that when he passed the Monument it was never
        of the Fire of London that he thought, always of Todgers&rsquo;s.) Mrs. Leo Hunter!
        Squeers! Silas Wegg and the Decline and Fall-off of the Russian Empire! Miss
        Mills and the Desert of Sahara! Wopsle acting Hamlet! Mrs. Jellyby! Mantalini,
        Jerry Cruncher, Barkis, Pumblechook, Tracy Tupman, Skimpole, Joe Gargery,
        Pecksniff&ndash;and so it goes on and on. It is not so much a series of books,
        it is more like a world. And not a purely comic world either, for part of what
        one remembers in Dickens is his Victorian morbidness and necrophilia and the
        blood-and-thunder scenes&ndash;the death of Sykes, Krook&rsquo;s spontaneous
        combustion, Fagin in the condemned cell, the women knitting round the
        guillotine. To a surprising extent all this has entered even into the minds of
        people who do not care about it. A music-hall comedian can (or at any rate
        could quite recently) go on the stage and impersonate Micawber or Mrs. Gamp
        with a fair certainty of being understood, although not one in twenty of the
        audience had ever read a book of Dickens&rsquo;s right through. Even people who
        affect to despise him quote him unconsciously.</p>
        <p>Dickens is a writer who can be imitated, up to a certain point. In genuinely
        popular literature&ndash;for instance, the Elephant and Castle version of
        <i>Sweeny Todd</i>&ndash;he has been plagiarized quite shamelessly. What has been
        imitated, however, is simply a tradition that Dickens himself took from earlier
        novelists and developed, the cult of &ldquo;character,&rdquo; i.e. eccentricity. The thing
        that cannot be imitated is his fertility of invention, which is invention not
        so much of characters, still less of &ldquo;situations,&rdquo; as of turns of phrase and
        concrete details. The outstanding, unmistakable mark of Dickens&rsquo;s writing is
        the <i>unnecessary detail</i>. Here is an example of what I mean. The story given
        below is not particularly funny, but there is one phrase in it that is as
        individual as a fingerprint. Mr. Jack Hopkins, at Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s party, is
        telling the story of the child who swallowed its sister&rsquo;s necklace:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          <p>Next day, child swallowed two beads; the day after that, he treated himself
          to three, and so on, till in a week&rsquo;s time he had got through the
          necklace&ndash;five-and-twenty beads in all. The sister, who was an industrious
          girl and seldom treated herself to a bit of finery, cried her eyes out at the
          loss of the necklace; looked high and low for it; but I needn't say, didn't
          find it. A few days afterwards, the family were at dinner&ndash;baked shoulder
          of mutton and potatoes under it&ndash;the child, who wasn't hungry, was playing
          about the room, when suddenly there was the devil of a noise, like a small
          hailstorm. &ldquo;Don't do that, my boy', says the father. &ldquo;I ain't a-doin' nothing,&rdquo;
          said the child. &ldquo;Well, don't do it again,&rdquo; said the father. There was a short
          silence, and then the noise began again, worse than ever. &ldquo;If you don't mind
          what I say, my boy,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;you'll find yourself in bed, in
          something less than a pig&rsquo;s whisper.&rdquo; He gave the child a shake to make him
          obedient, and such a rattling ensued as nobody ever heard before. &ldquo;Why dam' me,
          it&rsquo;s <i>in</i> the child,&rdquo; said the father; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got the croup in the wrong place!&rdquo;
          &ldquo;No, I haven't, father,&rdquo; said the child, beginning to cry, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the necklace;
          I swallowed it, father.&rdquo; The father caught the child up, and ran with him to
          the hospital, the beads in the boy&rsquo;s stomach rattling all the way with the
          jolting; and the people looking up in the air, and down in the cellars, to see
          where the unusual sound came from. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the hospital now,&rdquo; said Jack
          Hopkins, &ldquo;and he makes such a devil of a noise when he walks about, that
          they're obliged to muffle him in a watchman&rsquo;s coat, for fear he should wake the
          patients.&rdquo;</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a whole, this story might come out of any nineteenth-century comic paper.
        But the unmistakable Dickens touch, the thing that nobody else would have
        thought of, is the baked shoulder of mutton and potatoes under it. How does
        this advance the story? The answer is that it doesn't. It is something totally
        unnecessary, a florid little squiggle on the edge of the page; only, it is by
        just these squiggles that the special Dickens atmosphere is created. The other
        thing one would notice here is that Dickens&rsquo;s way of telling a story takes a
        long time. An interesting example, too long to quote, is Sam Weller&rsquo;s story of
        the obstinate patient in Chapter XLIV of <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>. As it happens, we
        have a standard of comparison here, because Dickens is plagiarizing,
        consciously or unconsciously. The story is also told by some ancient Greek
        writer. I cannot now find the passage, but I read it years ago as a boy at
        school, and it runs more or less like this:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          <p>A certain Thracian, renowned for his obstinacy, was warned by his physician
          that if he drank a flagon of wine it would kill him. The Thracian thereupon
          drank the flagon of wine and immediately jumped off the house-top and perished.
          &ldquo;For&rdquo;, said he, &ldquo;in this way I shall prove that the wine did not kill me.&rdquo;</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As the Greek tells it, that is the whole story&ndash;about six lines. As Sam
        Weller tells it, it takes round about a thousand words. Long before getting to
        the point we have been told all about the patient&rsquo;s clothes, his meals, his
        manners, even the newspapers he reads, and about the peculiar construction of
        the doctor&rsquo;s carriage, which conceals the fact that the coachman&rsquo;s trousers do
        not match his coat. Then there is the dialogue between the doctor and the
        patient. &ldquo;&lsquo;Crumpets is wholesome, sir,&rsquo; said the patient. &lsquo;Crumpets is <i>not</i>
        wholesome, sir,&rsquo; says the doctor, wery fierce,&rdquo; etc., etc. In the end the
        original story had been buried under the details. And in all of Dickens&rsquo;s most
        characteristic passages it is the same. His imagination overwhelms everything,
        like a kind of weed. Squeers stands up to address his boys, and immediately we
        are hearing about Bolder&rsquo;s father who was two pounds ten short, and Mobbs&rsquo;s
        stepmother who took to her bed on hearing that Mobbs wouldn't eat fat and hoped
        Mr. Squeers would flog him into a happier state of mind. Mrs. Leo Hunter writes
        a poem, &ldquo;Expiring Frog;&rdquo; two full stanzas are given. Boffin takes a fancy to
        pose as a miser, and instantly we are down among the squalid biographies of
        eighteenth-century misers, with names like Vulture Hopkins and the Rev.
        Blewberry Jones, and chapter headings like &ldquo;The Story of the Mutton Pies&rdquo; and
        &ldquo;The Treasures of a Dunghill.&rdquo; Mrs. Harris, who does not even exist, has more
        detail piled on to her than any three characters in an ordinary novel. Merely
        in the middle of a sentence we learn, for instance, that her infant nephew has
        been seen in a bottle at Greenwich Fair, along with the pink-eyed lady, the
        Prussian dwarf and the living skeleton. Joe Gargery describes how the robbers
        broke into the house of Pumblechook, the corn and seed merchant&ndash;&ldquo;and they
        took his till, and they took his cashbox, and they drinked his wine, and they
        partook of his wittles, and they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose,
        and they tied him up to his bedpost, and they give him a dozen, and they
        stuffed his mouth full of flowering annuals to prevent his crying out.&rdquo; Once
        again the unmistakable Dickens touch, the flowering annuals; but any other
        novelist would only have mentioned about half of these outrages. Everything is
        piled up and up, detail on detail, embroidery on embroidery. It is futile to
        object that this kind of thing is rococo&ndash;one might as well make the same
        objection to a wedding-cake. Either you like it or you do not like it. Other
        nineteenth-century writers, Surtees, Barham, Thackeray, even Marryat, have
        something of Dickens&rsquo;s profuse, overflowing quality, but none of them on
        anything like the same scale. The appeal of all these writers now depends
        partly on period-flavour and though Marryat is still officially a &ldquo;boy&rsquo;s
        writer&rdquo; and Surtees has a sort of legendary fame among hunting men, it is
        probable that they are read mostly by bookish people.</p>
        <p>Significantly, Dickens&rsquo;s most successful books (not his <i>best</i> books) are <i>the</i>
        <i>Pickwick Papers</i>, which is not a novel, and <i>Hard Times</i> and <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>,
        which are not funny. As a novelist his natural fertility greatly hampers him,
        because the burlesque which he is never able to resist, is constantly breaking
        into what ought to be serious situations. There is a good example of this in
        the opening chapter of <i>Great Expectations</i>. The escaped convict, Magwitch, has
        just captured the six-year-old Pip in the churchyard. The scene starts
        terrifyingly enough, from Pip&rsquo;s point of view. The convict, smothered in mud
        and with his chain trailing from his leg, suddenly starts up among the tombs,
        grabs the child, turns him upside down and robs his pockets. Then he begins
        terrorizing him into bringing foal and a file:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          <p>He held me by the arms in an upright position on the top of the stone, and
          went on in these fearful terms:</p>
          <p>&ldquo;You bring me, tomorrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You bring
          the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it and you never dare to
          say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as
          me, or any person sumever, and you shall be let to live. You fail, or you go
          from my words in any partickler, no matter how small it is, and your heart and
          liver shall be tore out, roasted and ate. Now, I ain't alone, as you may think
          I am. There&rsquo;s a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I am
          a Angel. That young man hears the words I speak. That young man has a secret
          way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his heart, and at his
          liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man.
          A boy may lock his doors, may be warm in bed, may tuck himself up, may draw the
          clothes over his head, may think himself comfortable and safe, but that young
          man will softly creep his way to him and tear him open. I am keeping that young
          man from harming you at the present moment, but with great difficulty. I find
          it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside. Now, what do you
          say?&rdquo;</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here Dickens has simply yielded to temptation. To begin with, no starving
        and hunted man would speak in the least like that. Moreover, although the
        speech shows a remarkable knowledge of the way in which a child&rsquo;s mind works,
        its actual words are quite out of tune with what is to follow. It turns
        Magwitch into a sort of pantomime wicked uncle, or, if one sees him through the
        child&rsquo;s eyes, into an appalling monster. Later in the book he is to be
        represented as neither, and his exaggerated gratitude, on which the plot turns,
        is to be incredible because of just this speech. As usual, Dickens&rsquo;s
        imagination has overwhelmed him. The picturesque details were too good to be
        left out. Even with characters who are more of a piece than Magwitch he is
        liable to be tripped up by some seductive phrase. Mr. Murdstone, for instance,
        is in the habit of ending David Copperfield&rsquo;s lessons every morning with a
        dreadful sum in arithmetic. &ldquo;If I go into a cheesemonger&rsquo;s shop, and buy four
        thousand double-Gloucester cheeses at fourpence halfpenny each, present
        payment,&rdquo; it always begins. Once again the typical Dickens detail, the
        double-Gloucester cheeses. But it is far too human a touch for Murdstone; he
        would have made it five thousand cashboxes. Every time this note is struck, the
        unity of the novel suffers. Not that it matters very much, because Dickens is
        obviously a writer whose parts are greater than his wholes. He is all
        fragments, all details&ndash;rotten architecture, but wonderful
        gargoyles&ndash;and never better than when he is building up some character who
        will later on be forced to act inconsistently.</p>
        <p>Of course it is not usual to urge against Dickens that he makes his
        characters behave inconsistently. Generally he is accused of doing just the
        opposite. His characters are supposed to be mere &ldquo;types', each crudely
        representing some single trait and fitted with a kind of label by which you
        recognize him. Dickens is &ldquo;only a caricaturist&rdquo;&ndash;that is the usual
        accusation, and it does him both more and less than justice. To begin with, he
        did not think of himself as a caricaturist, and was constantly setting into
        action characters who ought to have been purely static. Squeers, Micawber, Miss
        Mowcher,
        <sup>
          <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-1-source" class="footnote-link">
            Note 1, below
          </a>
        </sup>
        Wegg, Skimpole, Pecksniff and many others are finally
        involved in &ldquo;plots&rdquo; where they are out of place and where they behave quite
        incredibly. They start off as magic-lantern slides and they end by getting
        mixed up in a third-rate movie. Sometimes one can put one&rsquo;s finger on a single
        sentence in which the original illusion is destroyed. There is such a sentence
        in <i>David Copperfield</i>. After the famous dinner-party (the one where the leg of
        mutton was underdone), David is showing his guests out. He stops Traddles at
        the top of the stairs:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          <p>&ldquo;Traddles,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Mr. Micawber don't mean any harm, poor fellow: but if I
          were you I wouldn't lend him anything.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;My dear Copperfield,&rdquo; returned Traddles, smiling, &ldquo;I haven't got anything
          to lend.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;You have got a name, you know,' I said.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the place where one reads it this remark jars a little though something
        of the kind was inevitable sooner or later. The story is a fairly realistic
        one, and David is growing up; ultimately he is bound to see Mr. Micawber for
        what he is, a cadging scoundrel. Afterwards, of course, Dickens&rsquo;s
        sentimentality overcomes him and Micawber is made to turn over a new leaf. But
        from then on, the original Micawber is never quite recaptured, in spite of
        desperate efforts. As a rule, the &ldquo;plot&rdquo; in which Dickens&rsquo;s characters get
        entangled is not particularly credible, but at least it makes some pretence at
        reality, whereas the world to which they belong is a never-never land, a kind
        of eternity. But just here one sees that &ldquo;only a caricaturist&rdquo; is not really a
        condemnation. The fact that Dickens is always thought of as a caricaturist,
        although he was constantly trying to be something else, is perhaps the surest
        mark of his genius. The monstrosities that he created are still remembered as
        monstrosities, in spite of getting mixed up in would-be probable melodramas.
        Their first impact is so vivid that nothing that comes afterwards effaces it.
        As with the people one knew in childhood, one seems always to remember them in
        one particular attitude, doing one particular thing. Mrs. Squeers is always
        ladling out brimstone and treacle, Mrs. Gummidge is always weeping, Mrs.
        Gargery is always banging her husband&rsquo;s head against the wall, Mrs. Jellyby is
        always scribbling tracts while her children fall into the area&ndash;and there
        they all are, fixed up for ever like little twinkling miniatures painted on
        snuffbox lids, completely fantastic and incredible, and yet somehow more solid
        and infinitely more memorable than the efforts of serious novelists. Even by
        the standards of his time Dickens was an exceptionally artificial writer. As
        Ruskin said, he &ldquo;chose to work in a circle of stage fire.&rdquo; His characters are
        even more distorted and simplified than Smollett&rsquo;s. But there are no rules in
        novel-writing, and for any work of art there is only one test worth bothering
        about&ndash;survival. By this test Dickens&rsquo;s characters have succeeded, even if
        the people who remember them hardly think of them as human beings. They are
        monsters, but at any rate they exist.</p>
        <p>But all the same there is a disadvantage in writing about monsters. It
        amounts to this, that it is only certain moods that Dickens can speak to. There
        are large areas of the human mind that he never touches. There is no poetic
        feeling anywhere in his books, and no genuine tragedy, and even sexual love is
        almost outside his scope. Actually his books are not so sexless as they are
        sometimes declared to be, and considering the time in which he was writing, he
        is reasonably frank. But there is not a trace in him of the feeling that one
        finds in <i>Manon Lescaut</i>, <i>Salammb&ocirc;</i>, <i>Carmen</i>, <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. According to
        Aldous Huxley, D.H. Lawrence once said that Balzac was &ldquo;a gigantic dwarf,&rdquo; and
        in a sense the same is true of Dickens. There are whole worlds which he either
        knows nothing about or does not wish to mention. Except in a rather roundabout
        way, one cannot learn very much from Dickens. And to say this is to think
        almost immediately of the great Russian novelists of the nineteenth century.
        Why is it that Tolstoy&rsquo;s grasp seems to be so much larger than
        Dickens&rsquo;s&ndash;why is it that he seems able to tell you so much more <i>about yourself</i>
        ? It is not that he is more gifted, or even, in the last analysis, more
        intelligent. It is because he is writing about people who are growing. His
        characters are struggling to make their souls, whereas Dickens&rsquo;s are already
        finished and perfect. In my own mind Dickens&rsquo;s people are present far more
        often and far more vividly than Tolstoy&rsquo;s, but always in a single unchangeable
        attitude, like pictures or pieces of furniture. You cannot hold an imaginary
        conversation with a Dickens character as you can with, say, Peter Bezoukhov.
        And this is not merely because of Tolstoy&rsquo;s greater seriousness, for there are
        also comic characters that you can imagine yourself talking to&ndash;Bloom, for
        instance, or Pecuchet, or even Wells&rsquo;s Mr. Polly. It is because Dickens&rsquo;s
        characters have no mental life. They say perfectly the thing that they have to
        say, but they cannot be conceived as talking about anything else. They never
        learn, never speculate. Perhaps the most meditative of his characters is Paul
        Dombey, and his thoughts are mush. Does this mean that Tolstoy&rsquo;s novels are
        &ldquo;better&rdquo; than Dickens&rsquo;s? The truth is that it is absurd to make such
        comparisons in terms of &ldquo;better&rdquo; and &ldquo;worse&rdquo;. If I were forced to compare
        Tolstoy with Dickens, I should say that Tolstoy&rsquo;s appeal will probably be wider
        in the long run, because Dickens is scarcely intelligible outside the
        English-speaking culture; on the other hand, Dickens is able to reach simple
        people, which Tolstoy is not. Tolstoy&rsquo;s characters can cross a frontier,
        Dickens can be portrayed on a cigarette-card. But one is no more obliged to
        choose between them than between a sausage and a rose. Their purposes barely
        intersect.</p>
        <h1 class="chapter-marker">VI</h1>
        <p>If Dickens had been merely a comic writer, the chances are that no one would
        now remember his name. Or at best a few of his books would survive in rather
        the same way as books like <i>Frank Fairleigh</i>, <i>Mr. Verdant Green</i> and <i>Mrs. Caudle&rsquo;s
        Curtain Lectures</i>, as a sort of hangover of the Victorian atmosphere, a pleasant
        little whiff of oysters and brown stout. Who has not felt sometimes that it was
        &ldquo;a pity&rdquo; that Dickens ever deserted the vein of <i>Pickwick</i> for things like <i>Little Dorrit</i>
        and <i>Hard Times</i>? What people always demand of a popular novelist is that
        he shall write the same book over and over again, forgetting that a man who
        would write the same book twice could not even write it once. Any writer who is
        not utterly lifeless moves upon a kind of parabola, and the downward curve is
        implied in the upper one. Joyce has to start with the frigid competence of
        <i>Dubliners</i> and end with the dream-language of <i>Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake</i>, but <i>Ulysses</i> and
        <i>Portrait of the Artist</i> are part of the trajectory. The thing that drove Dickens
        forward into a form of art for which he was not really suited, and at the same
        time caused us to remember him, was simply the fact that he was a moralist, the
        consciousness of &ldquo;having something to say.&rdquo; He is always preaching a sermon,
        and that is the final secret of his inventiveness. For you can only create if
        you can <i>care</i>. Types like Squeers and Micawber could not have been produced by a
        hack writer looking for something to be funny about. A joke worth laughing at
        always has an idea behind it, and usually a subversive idea. Dickens is able to
        go on being funny because he is in revolt against authority, and authority is
        always there to be laughed at. There is always room for one more custard
        pie.</p>
        <p>His radicalism is of the vaguest kind, and yet one always knows that it is
        there. That is the difference between being a moralist and a politician. He has
        no constructive suggestions, not even a clear grasp of the nature of the
        society he is attacking, only an emotional perception that something is wrong,
        all he can finally say is, &ldquo;Behave decently,&rdquo; which, as I suggested earlier, is
        not necessarily so shallow as it sounds. Most revolutionaries are potential
        Tories, because they imagine that everything can be put right by altering the
        <i>shape</i> of society; once that change is effected, as it sometimes is, they see no
        need for any other. Dickens has not this kind of mental coarseness. The
        vagueness of his discontent is the mark of its permanence. What he is out
        against is not this or that institution, but, as Chesterton put it, &ldquo;an
        expression on the human face.&rdquo; Roughly speaking, his morality is the Christian
        morality, but in spite of his Anglican upbringing he was essentially a
        Bible-Christian, as he took care to make plain when writing his will. In any
        case he cannot properly be described as a religious man. He &ldquo;believed&rdquo;,
        undoubtedly, but religion in the devotional sense does not seem to have entered
        much into his thoughts.

        </sup>
        Where he is Christian is in his
        quasi-instinctive siding with the oppressed against the oppressors. As a matter
        of course he is on the side of the underdog, always and everywhere. To carry
        this to its logical conclusion one has got to change sides when the underdog
        becomes an upper-dog, and in fact Dickens does tend to do so. He loathes the
        Catholic Church, for instance, but as soon as the Catholics are persecuted
        (<i>Barnaby Rudge</i>) he is on their side. He loathes the aristocratic class even
        more, but as soon as they are really overthrown (the revolutionary chapters in
        <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>) his sympathies swing round. Whenever he departs from this
        emotional attitude he goes astray. A well-known example is at the ending of
        <i>David Copperfield</i>, in which everyone who reads it feels that something has gone
        wrong. What is wrong is that the closing chapters are pervaded, faintly but not
        noticeably, by the cult of success. It is the gospel according to Smiles,
        instead of the gospel according to Dickens. The attractive, out-at-elbow
        characters are got rid of, Micawber makes a fortune, Heep gets into
        prison&ndash;both of these events are flagrantly impossible&ndash;and even Dora
        is killed off to make way for Agnes. If you like, you can read Dora as
        Dickens&rsquo;s wife and Agnes as his sister-in-law, but the essential point is that
        Dickens has &ldquo;turned respectable&rdquo; and done violence to his own nature. Perhaps
        that is why Agnes is the most disagreeable of his heroines, the real legless
        angel of Victorian romance, almost as bad as Thackeray&rsquo;s Laura.</p>
        <p>No grown-up person can read Dickens without feeling his limitations, and yet
        there does remain his native generosity of mind, which acts as a kind of anchor
        and nearly always keeps him where he belongs. It is probably the central secret
        of his popularity. A good-tempered antinomianism rather of Dickens&rsquo;s type is
        one of the marks of Western popular culture. One sees it in folk-stories and
        comic songs, in dream-figures like Mickey Mouse and Pop-eye the Sailor (both of
        them variants of Jack the Giant-killer), in the history of working-class
        Socialism, in the popular protests (always ineffective but not always a sham)
        against imperialism, in the impulse that makes a jury award excessive damages
        when a rich man&rsquo;s car runs over a poor man; it is the feeling that one is
        always on the wrong side of the underdog, on the side of the weak against the
        strong. In one sense it is a feeling that is fifty years out of date. The
        common man is still living in the mental world of Dickens, but nearly every
        modern intellectual has gone over to some or other form of totalitarianism.
        From the Marxist or Fascist point of view, nearly all that Dickens stands for
        can be written off as &ldquo;bourgeois morality.&rdquo; But in moral outlook no one could
        be more &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; than the English working classes. The ordinary people in
        the Western countries have never entered, mentally, into the world of &ldquo;realism&rdquo;
        and power-politics. They may do so before long, in which case Dickens will be
        as out of date as the cab-horse. But in his own age and ours he has been
        popular chiefly because he was able to express in a comic, simplified and
        therefore memorable form the native decency of the common man. And it is
        important that from this point of view people of very different types can be
        described as &ldquo;common.&rdquo; In a country like England, in spite of its
        class-structure, there does exist a certain cultural unity. All through the
        Christian ages, and especially since the French Revolution, the Western world
        has been haunted by the idea of freedom and equality; it is only an <i>idea</i>, but
        it has penetrated to all ranks of society. The most atrocious injustices,
        cruelties, lies, snobberies exist everywhere, but there are not many people who
        can regard these things with the same indifference as, say, a Roman
        slave-owner. Even the millionaire suffers from a vague sense of guilt, like a
        dog eating a stolen leg of mutton. Nearly everyone, whatever his actual conduct
        may be, responds emotionally to the idea of human brotherhood. Dickens voiced a
        code which was and on the whole still is believed in, even by people who
        violate it. It is difficult otherwise to explain why he could be both read by
        working people (a thing that has happened to no other novelist of his stature)
        and buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>
        <p>When one reads any strongly individual piece of writing, one has the
        impression of seeing a face somewhere behind the page. It is not necessarily
        the actual face of the writer. I feel this very strongly with Swift, with
        Defoe, with Fielding, Stendhal, Thackeray, Flaubert, though in several cases I
        do not know what these people looked like and do not want to know. What one
        sees is the face that the writer <i>ought</i> to have. Well, in the case of Dickens I
        see a face that is not quite the face of Dickens&lsquo;s photographs, though it
        resembles it. It is the face of a man of about forty, with a small beard and a
        high colour. He is laughing, with a touch of anger in his laughter, but no
        triumph, no malignity. It is the face of a man who is always fighting against
        something, but who fights in the open and is not frightened, the face of a man
        who is <i>generously angry</i>&ndash;in other words, of a nineteenth-century liberal,
        a free intelligence, a type hated with equal hatred by all the smelly little
        orthodoxies which are now contending for our souls.</p>

        <p>Dickens turned Miss Mowcher into a sort of heroine because the real
        woman whom he had caricatured had read the earlier chapters and was bitterly
        hurt. He had previously meant her to play a villainous part. But <i>any</i> action by
        such a character would seem incongruous. (Author&rsquo;s footnote)</p>

        <p>From a letter to his youngest son (in 1868): &ldquo;You will remember that
        you have never at home been harassed about religious observances, or mere
        formalities. I have always been anxious not to weary my children with such
        things, before they are old enough to form opinions respecting them. You will
        therefore understand the better that I now most solemnly impress upon you the
        truth and beauty of the Christian Religion, as it came from Christ Himself, and
        the impossibility of your going far wrong if you humbly but heartily respect
        it&hellip;Never abandon the wholesome practice of saying your own private prayers,
        night and morning. I have never abandoned it myself, and I know the comfort of
        it.&rdquo; (Author&rsquo;s footnote)</p>
