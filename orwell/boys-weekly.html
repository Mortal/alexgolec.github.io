        You never walk far through any poor quarter in any big town without coming
        upon a small newsagent&rsquo;s shop. The general appearance of these shops is always
        very much the same: a few posters for the <i>Daily Mail</i> and the <i>New of the World</i>
        outside, a poky little window with sweet-bottles and packets of Players, and a
        dark interior smelling of liquorice allsorts and festooned from floor to
        ceiling with vilely printed twopenny papers, most of them with lurid
        cover-illustrations in three colours.</p>
        <p>Except for the daily and evening papers, the stock of these shops hardly
        overlaps at all with that of the big news-agents. Their main selling line is
        the twopenny weekly, and the number and variety of these are almost
        unbelievable. Every hobby and pastime&ndash;cage-birds, fretwork, carpentering,
        bees, carrier-pigeons, home conjuring, philately, chess&ndash;has at least one
        paper devoted to it, and generally several. Gardening and livestock-keeping
        must have at least a score between them. Then there are the sporting papers,
        the radio papers, the children&rsquo;s comics, the various snippet papers such as
        <i>Tit-Bits,</i>, the large range of papers devoted to the movies and all more or less
        exploiting women&rsquo;s legs, the various trade papers, the women&rsquo;s story-papers
        (the <i>Oracle</i>, <i>Secrets</i>, <i>Peg&rsquo;s Paper</i>, etc. etc.), the needlework
        papers&ndash;these so numerous that a display of them alone will often fill an
        entire window&ndash;and in addition the long series of &ldquo;Yank Mags&rdquo; (<i>Fight Stories</i>,
        <i>Action Stories</i>, <i>Western Short Stories</i>, etc.), which are imported
        shop-soiled from America and sold at twopence halfpenny or threepence. And the
        periodical proper shades off into the fourpenny novelette, the <i>Aldine Boxing Novels</i>,
        the <i>Boys&rsquo; Friend Library</i>, the <i>Schoolgirls&rsquo; Own Library</i> and many
        others.</p>
        <p>Probably the contents of these shops is the best available indication of
        what the mass of the English people really feels and thinks. Certainly nothing
        half so revealing exists in documentary form. Best-seller novels, for instance,
        tell one a great deal, but the novel is aimed almost exclusively at people
        above the &pound;4-a-week level. The movies are probably a very unsafe guide to
        popular taste, because the film industry is virtually a monopoly, which means
        that it is not obliged to study its public at all closely. The same applies to
        some extent to the daily papers, and most of all to the radio. But it does not
        apply to the weekly paper with a smallish circulation and specialized
        subject-matter. Papers like the <i>Exchange and Mart</i>, for instance, or <i>Cage-Birds</i>,
        or the <i>Oracle</i>, or the <i>Prediction</i>, or the <i>Matrimonial Times</i>, only exist because
        there is a definite demand for them, and they reflect the minds of their
        readers as a great national daily with a circulation of millions cannot
        possibly do.</p>
        <p>Here I am only dealing with a single series of papers, the boys&rsquo; twopenny
        weeklies, often inaccurately described as &ldquo;penny dreadfuls&rdquo;. Falling strictly
        within this class there are at present ten papers, the <i>Gem</i>, <i>Magnet</i>, <i>Modern Boy</i>,
        <i>Triumph</i> and <i>Champion</i>, all owned by the Amalgamated Press, and the <i>Wizard</i>,
        <i>Rover</i>, <i>Skipper</i>, <i>Hotspur</i> and <i>Adventure</i>, all owned by D. C. Thomson &amp; Co.
        What the circulations of these papers are, I do not know. The editors and
        proprietors refuse to name any figures, and in any case the circulation of a
        paper carrying serial stories is bound to fluctuate widely. But there is no
        question that the combined public of the ten papers is a very large one. They
        are on sale in every town in England, and nearly every boy who reads at all
        goes through a phase of reading one or more of them. The <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>, which
        are much the oldest of these papers, are of rather different type from the
        rest, and they have evidently lost some of their popularity during the past few
        years. A good many boys now regard them as old fashioned and &ldquo;slow&rdquo;.
        Nevertheless I want to discuss them first, because they are more interesting
        psychologically than the others, and also because the mere survival of such
        papers into the nineteen-thirties is a rather startling phenomenon.</p>
        <p>The <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> are sister-papers (characters out of one paper frequently
        appear in the other), and were both started more than thirty years ago. At that
        time, together with Chums and the old B[oy&rsquo;s] O[wn] P[aper], they were the
        leading papers for boys, and they remained dominant till quite recently. Each
        of them carries every week a fifteen&ndash;or twenty-thousand-word school
        story, complete in itself, but usually more or less connected with the story of
        the week before. The <i>Gem</i> in addition to its school story carries one or more
        adventure serial. Otherwise the two papers are so much alike that they can be
        treated as one, though the <i>Magnet</i> has always been the better known of the two,
        probably because it possesses a really first-rate character in the fat boy.
        Billy Bunter.</p>
        <p>The stories are stories of what purports to be public-school life, and the
        schools (Greyfriars in the <i>Magnet</i> and St Jim&rsquo;s in the <i>Gem</i>) are represented as
        ancient and fashionable foundations of the type of Eton or Winchester. All the
        leading characters are fourth-form boys aged fourteen or fifteen, older or
        younger boys only appearing in very minor parts. Like Sexton Blake and Nelson
        Lee, these boys continue week after week and year after year, never growing any
        older. Very occasionally a new boy arrives or a minor character drops out, but
        in at any rate the last twenty-five years the personnel has barely altered. All
        the principal characters in both papers&ndash;Bob Cherry, Tom Merry, Harry
        Wharton, Johnny Bull, Billy Bunter and the rest of them&ndash;were at
        Greyfriars or St Jim&rsquo;s long before the Great War, exactly the same age as at
        present, having much the same kind of adventures and talking almost exactly the
        same dialect. And not only the characters but the whole atmosphere of both <i>Gem</i>
        and Magnet has been preserved unchanged, partly by means of very elaborate
        stylization. The stories in the Magnet are signed &ldquo;Frank Richards&rdquo; and those in
        the <i>Gem</i>, &ldquo;Martin Clifford&rdquo;, but a series lasting thirty years could hardly be
        the work of the same person every week. Consequently they have to be written in
        a style that is easily imitated&ndash;an extraordinary, artificial, repetitive
        style, quite different from anything else now existing in English literature. A
        couple of extracts will do as illustrations. Here is one from the <i>Magnet</i>:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">Groan!</li>
          <li class="quote-text">&ldquo;Shut up, Bunter!&rdquo;</li>
          <li class="quote-text">Groan!</li>
          <li class="quote-text">Shutting up was not really in Billy Bunter&rsquo;s line. He seldom shut up, though
          often requested to do so. On the present awful occasion the fat Owl of
          Greyfriars was less inclined than ever to shut up. And he did not shut up! He
          groaned, and groaned, and went on groaning.</li>
          <li class="quote-text">Even groaning did not fully express Bunter&rsquo;s feelings. His feelings, in
          fact, were inexpressible.</li>
          <li class="quote-text">There were six of them in the soup! Only one of the six uttered sounds of
          woe and lamentation. But that one, William George Bunter, uttered enough for
          the whole party and a little over.</li>
          <li class="quote-text">Harry Wharton &amp; Go. stood in a wrathy and worried group. They were
          landed and stranded, diddled, dished and done! etc., etc., etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is one from the <i>Gem</i>:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">&ldquo;Oh cwumbs!&rdquo;</li>
          <li class="quote-text">&ldquo;Oh gum!&rdquo;</li>
          <li class="quote-text">&ldquo;Oooogh!&rdquo;</li>
          <li class="quote-text">&ldquo;Urrggh!&rdquo;</li>
          <li class="quote-text">Arthur Augustus sat up dizzily. He grabbed his handkerchief and pressed it
          to his damaged nose. Tom Merry sat up, gasping for breath. They looked at one
          another.</li>
          <li class="quote-text">&ldquo;Bai Jove! This is a go, deah boy!&rdquo; gurgled Arthur Augustus. &ldquo;I have been
          thwown into quite a fluttah! Oogh! The wottahs! The wuffians! The feahful
          outsidahs! Wow!&rdquo; etc., etc., etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both of these extracts are entirely typical: you would find something like
        them in almost every chapter of every number, to-day or twenty-five years ago.
        The first thing that anyone would notice is the extraordinary amount of
        tautology (the first of these two passages contains a hundred and twenty-five
        words and could be compressed into about thirty), seemingly designed to spin
        out the story, but actually playing its part in creating the atmosphere. For
        the same reason various facetious expressions are repeated over and over again;
        &ldquo;wrathy&rdquo;, for instance, is a great favourite, and so is &ldquo;diddled, dished and
        done&rdquo;. &ldquo;Oooogh!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Grooo!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yaroo!&rdquo; (stylized cries of pain) recur
        constantly, and so does &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;, always given a line to itself, so that
        sometimes a quarter of a column or thereabouts consists of &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; The
        slang (&ldquo;Go and cat coke!&rdquo;, &ldquo;What the thump!&rdquo;, &ldquo;You frabjous ass!&rdquo;, etc. etc.)
        has never been altered, so that the boys are now using slang which is at least
        thirty years out of date. In addition, the various nicknames are rubbed in on
        every possible occasion. Every few lines we are reminded that Harry Wharton
        &amp; Co. are &ldquo;the Famous Five&rdquo;, Bunter is always &ldquo;the fat Owl&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Owl of
        the Remove&rdquo;, Vernon-Smith is always &ldquo;the Bounder of Greyfriars&rdquo;, Gussy (the
        Honourable Arthur Augustus D&rsquo;Arcy) is always &ldquo;the swell of St Jim&rsquo;s&rdquo;, and so on
        and so forth. There is a constant, untiring effort to keep the atmosphere
        intact and to make sure that every new reader learns immediately who is who.
        The result has been to make Greyfriars and St Jim&rsquo;s into an extraordinary
        little world of their own, a world which cannot be taken seriously by anyone
        over fifteen, but which at any rate is not easily forgotten. By a debasement of
        the Dickens technique a series of stereotyped &ldquo;characters&rdquo; has been built up,
        in several cases very successfully. Billy Bunter, for instance, must be one of
        the best-known figures in English fiction; for the mere number of people who
        know him he ranks with Sexton Blake, Tarzan, Sherlock Holmes and a handful of
        characters in Dickens.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, these stories are fantastically unlike life at a real
        public school. They run in cycles of rather differing types, but in general
        they are the clean-fun, knock-about type of story, with interest centring round
        horseplay, practical jokes, ragging roasters, fights, canings, football,
        cricket and food. A constantly recurring story is one in which a boy is accused
        of some misdeed committed by another and is too much of a sportsman to reveal
        the truth. The &ldquo;good&rdquo; boys are &ldquo;good&rdquo; in the clean-living Englishman
        tradition&ndash;they keep in hard training, wash behind their ears, never hit
        below the belt etc., etc.,&ndash;and by way of contrast there is a series of
        &ldquo;bad&rdquo; boys, Racke, Crooke, Loder and others, whose badness consists in betting,
        smoking cigarettes and frequenting public-houses. All these boys are constantly
        on the verge of expulsion, but as it would mean a change of personnel if any
        boy were actually expelled, no one is ever caught out in any really serious
        offence. Stealing, for instance, barely enters as a motif. Sex is completely
        taboo, especially in the form in which it actually arises at public schools.
        Occasionally girls enter into the stories, and very rarely there is something
        approaching a mild flirtation, but it is entirely in the spirit of clean fun. A
        boy and a girl enjoy going for bicycle rides together&ndash;that is all it ever
        amounts to. Kissing, for instance, would be regarded as &ldquo;soppy&rdquo;. Even the bad
        boys are presumed to be completely sexless. When the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> were
        started, it is probable that there was a deliberate intention to get away from
        the guilty sex-ridden atmosphere that pervaded so much of the earlier
        literature for boys. In the nineties the <i>Boy&rsquo;s Own Paper</i>, for instance, used to
        have its correspondence columns full of terrifying warnings against
        masturbation, and books like <i>St Winifred&rsquo;s</i> and <i>Tom Brown&rsquo;s School-Days</i> were
        heavy with homosexual feeling, though no doubt the authors were not fully aware
        of it. In the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> sex simply does not exist as a problem. Religion
        is also taboo; in the whole thirty years&rsquo; issue of the two papers the word
        &ldquo;God&rdquo; probably does not occur, except in &ldquo;God save the King&rdquo;. On the other
        hand, there has always been a very strong &ldquo;temperance&rdquo; strain. Drinking and, by
        association, smoking are regarded as rather disgraceful even in an adult
        (&ldquo;shady&rdquo; is the usual word), but at the same time as something irresistibly
        fascinating, a sort of substitute for sex. In their moral atmosphere the <i>Gem</i>
        and <i>Magnet</i> have a great deal in common with the Boy Scout movement, which
        started at about the same time.</p>
        <p>All literature of this kind is partly plagiarism. Sexton Blake, for
        instance, started off quite frankly as an imitation of Sherlock Holmes, and
        still resembles him fairly strongly; he has hawk-like features, lives in Baker
        Street, smokes enormously and puts on a dressing-gown when he wants to think.
        The <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> probably owe something to the old school-story writers who
        were flourishing when they began, Gunby Hadath, Desmond Coke and the rest, but
        they owe more to nineteenth-century models. In so far as Greyfriars and St
        Jim&rsquo;s are like real schools at all, they are much more like Tom Brown&rsquo;s Rugby
        than a modern public school. Neither school has an O.T.G., for instance, games
        are not compulsory, and the boys are even allowed to wear what clothes they
        like. But without doubt the main origin of these papers is <i>Stalky &amp; Co.</i>
        This book has had an immense influence on boys&rsquo; literature, and it is one of
        those books which have a sort of traditional reputation among people who have
        never even seen a copy of it. More than once in boys&rsquo; weekly papers I have come
        across a reference to <i>Stalky &amp; Co.</i> in which the word was spelt &ldquo;Storky&rdquo;.
        Even the name of the chief comic among the Greyfriars masters, Mr Prout, is
        taken from <i>Stalky &amp; Co.</i>, and so is much of the slang; &ldquo;jape&rdquo;,
        &ldquo;merry&rdquo;,&ldquo;giddy&rdquo;, &ldquo;bizney&rdquo; (business), &ldquo;frabjous&rdquo;, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo; for
        &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&ndash;all of them out of date even when <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> started. There
        are also traces of earlier origins. The name &ldquo;Greyfriars&rdquo; is probably taken
        from Thackeray, and Gosling, the school porter in the <i>Magnet</i>, talks in an
        imitation of Dickens&rsquo;s dialect.</p>
        <p>With all this, the supposed &ldquo;glamour&rdquo; of public-school life is played for
        all it is worth. There is all the usual paraphernalia&ndash;lock-up, roll-call,
        house matches, fagging, prefects, cosy teas round the study fire, etc.
        etc.&ndash;and constant reference to the &ldquo;old school&rdquo;, the &ldquo;old grey stones&rdquo;
        (both schools were founded in the early sixteenth century), the &ldquo;team spirit&rdquo;
        of the &ldquo;Greyfriars men&rdquo;. As for the snob-appeal, it is completely shameless.
        Each school has a titled boy or two whose titles are constantly thrust in the
        reader&rsquo;s face; other boys have the names of well-known aristocratic families,
        Talbot, Manners, Lowther. We are for ever being reminded that Gussy is the
        Honourable Arthur A. D&rsquo;Arcy, son of Lord Eastwood, that Jack Blake is heir to
        &ldquo;broad acres&rdquo;, that Hurree Jamset Ram Singh (nicknamed Inky) is the Nabob of
        Bhanipur, that Vernon-Smith&rsquo;s father is a millionaire. Till recently the
        illustrations in both papers always depicted the boys in clothes imitated from
        those of Eton; in the last few years Greyfriars has changed over to blazers and
        flannel trousers, but St Jim&rsquo;s still sticks to the Eton jacket, and Gussy
        sticks to his top-hat. In the school magazine which appears every week as part
        of the <i>Magnet</i>, Harry Wharton writes an article discussing the pocket-money
        received by the &ldquo;fellows in the Remove&rdquo;, and reveals that some of them get as
        much as five pounds a week! This kind of thing is a perfectly deliberate
        incitement to wealth-fantasy. And here it is worth noticing a rather curious
        fact, and that is that the school story is a thing peculiar to England. So far
        as I know, there are extremely few school stories in foreign languages. The
        reason, obviously, is that in England education is mainly a matter of status.
        The most definite dividing line between the petite-bourgeoisie and the working
        class is that the former pay for their education, and within the bourgeoisie
        there is another unbridgeable gulf between the &ldquo;public&rdquo; school and the
        &ldquo;private&rdquo; school. It is quite clear that there are tens and scores of thousands
        of people to whom every detail of life at a &ldquo;posh&rdquo; public school is wildly
        thrilling and romantic. They happen to be outside that mystic world of
        quadrangles and house-colours, but they can yearn after it, day-dream about it,
        live mentally in it for hours at a stretch. The question is, Who are these
        people? Who reads the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>?</p>
        <p>Obviously one can never be quite certain about this kind of thing. All I can
        say from my own observation is this. Boys who are likely to go to public
        schools themselves generally read the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>, but they nearly always
        stop reading them when they are about twelve; they may continue for another
        year from force of habit, but by that time they have ceased to take them
        seriously. On the other hand, the boys at very cheap private schools, the
        schools that are designed for people who can&rsquo;t afford a public school but
        consider the Council schools &ldquo;common&rdquo;, continue reading the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> for
        several years longer. A few years ago I was a teacher at two of these schools
        myself. I found that not only did virtually all the boys read the <i>Gem</i> and
        <i>Magnet</i>, but that they were still taking them fairly seriously when they were
        fifteen or even sixteen. These boys were the sons of shopkeepers, office
        employees and small business and professional men, and obviously it is this
        class that the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> are aimed at. But they are certainly read by
        working-class boys as well. They are generally on sale in the poorest quarters
        of big towns, and I have known them to be read by boys whom one might expect to
        be completely immune from public-school &ldquo;glamour&rdquo;. I have seen a young coal
        miner, for instance, a lad who had already worked a year or two underground,
        eagerly reading the <i>Gem</i>. Recently I offered a batch of English papers to some
        British legionaries of the French Foreign Legion in North Africa; they picked
        out the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> first. Both papers are much read by girls, and the Pen
        Pals department of the <i>Gem</i> shows that it is read in every corner of the British
        Empire, by Australians, Canadians, Palestine Jews, Malays, Arabs, Straits
        Chinese, etc., etc. The editors evidently expect their readers to be aged round
        about fourteen, and the advertisements (milk chocolate, postage stamps, water
        pistols, blushing cured, home conjuring tricks, itching powder, the Phine Phun
        Ring which runs a needle into your friend&rsquo;s hand, etc., etc.) indicate roughly
        the same age; there are also the Admiralty advertisements, however, which call
        for youths between seventeen and twenty-two. And there is no question that
        these papers are also read by adults. It is quite common for people to write to
        the editor and say that they have read every number of the <i>Gem</i> or <i>Magnet</i> for
        the past thirty years. Here, for instance, is a letter from a lady in
        Salisbury:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          I can say of your splendid yams of Harry Wharton &amp; Co. of Greyfriars,
          that they never fail to reach a high standard. Without doubt they are the
          finest stories of their type on the market to-day, which is saying a good deal.
          They seem to bring you face to face with Nature. I have taken the Magnet from
          the start, and have followed the adventures of Harry Wharton &amp; Co. with
          rapt interest. I have no sons, but two daughters, and there&rsquo;s always a rush to
          be the first to read the grand old paper. My husband, too, was a staunch reader
          of the Magnet until he was suddenly taken away from us.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is well worth getting hold of some copies of the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>,
        especially the <i>Gem</i>, simply to have a look at the correspondence columns. What
        is truly startling is the intense interest with which the pettiest details of
        life at Greyfriars and St Jim&rsquo;s are followed up. Here, for instance, are a few
        of the questions sent in by readers:</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is clear that many of the boys and girls who write these letters are
        living a complete fantasy-life. Sometimes a boy will write, for instance,
        giving his age, height, weight, chest and bicep measurements and asking which
        member of the Shell or Fourth Form he most exactly resembles. The demand for a
        list of the studies on the Shell passage, with an exact account of who lives in
        each, is a very common one. The editors, of course, do everything in their
        power to keep up the illusion. In the <i>Gem</i> Jack Blake is supposed to write
        answers to correspondents, and in the <i>Magnet</i> a couple of pages is always given
        up to the school magazine (the <i>Greyfriars Herald</i>, edited by Harry Wharton), and
        there is another page in which one or other character is written up each week.
        The stories run in cycles, two or three characters being kept in the foreground
        for several weeks at a time. First there will be a series of rollicking
        adventure stories, featuring the Famous Five and Billy Bunter; then a run of
        stories turning on mistaken identity, with Wibley (the make-up wizard) in the
        star part; then a run of more serious stories in which Vernon-Smith is
        trembling on the verge of expulsion. And here one comes upon the real secret of
        the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> and the probable reason why they continue to be read in
        spite of their obvious out-of-dateness.</p>
        <p>It is that the characters are so carefully graded as to give almost every
        type of reader a character he can identify himself with. Most boys&rsquo; papers aim
        at doing this, hence the boy-assistant (Sexton Blake&rsquo;s Tinker, Nelson Lee&rsquo;s
        Nipper, etc.) who usually accompanies the explorer, detective or what-not on
        his adventures. But in these cases there is only one boy, and usually it is
        much the same type of boy. In the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> there is a model for very
        nearly everybody. There is the normal athletic, high-spirited boy (Tom Merry,
        Jack Blake, Frank Nugent), a slightly rowdier version of this type (Bob
        Cherry), a more aristocratic version (Talbot, Manners), a quieter, more serious
        version (Harry Wharton), and a stolid, &ldquo;bulldog&rdquo; version (Johnny Bull). Then
        there is the reckless, dare-devil type of boy (Vernon-Smith), the definitely
        &ldquo;clever&rdquo;, studious boy (Mark Linley, Dick Penfold), and the eccentric boy who
        is not good at games but possesses some special talent (Skinner Wibley). And
        there is the scholarship-boy (Tom Redwing), an important figure in this class
        of story because he makes it possible for boys from very poor homes to project
        themselves into the public-school atmosphere. In addition there are Australian,
        Irish, Welsh, Manx, Yorkshire and Lancashire boys to play upon local
        patriotism. But the subtlety of characterization goes deeper than this. If one
        studies the correspondence columns one sees that there is probably <i>no</i> character
        in the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> whom some or other reader does not identify with, except
        the out-and-out comics, Coker, Billy Bunter, Fisher T. Fish (the money-grabbing
        American boy) and, of course, the masters. Bunter, though in his origin he
        probably owed something to the fat boy in <i>Pickwick</i>, is a real creation. His
        tight trousers against which boots and canes are constantly thudding, his
        astuteness in search of food, his postal order which never turns up, have made
        him famous wherever the Union Jack waves. But he is not a subject for
        day-dreams. On the other hand, another seeming figure of fun, Gussy (the
        Honourable Arthur A. D&rsquo;Arcy, &ldquo;the swell of St Jim&rsquo;s&rdquo;), is evidently much
        admired. Like everything else in the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>, Gussy is at least thirty
        years out of date. He is the &ldquo;knut&rdquo; of the early twentieth century or even the
        &ldquo;masher&rdquo; of the nineties (&ldquo;Bai Jove, deah boy!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Weally, I shall be obliged
        to give you a feahful thwashin&rdquo;!&rdquo;), the monocled idiot who made good on the
        fields of Mons and Le Gateau. And his evident popularity goes to show how deep
        the snob-appeal of this type is. English people are extremely fond of the
        titled ass (cf. Lord Peter Whimsey) who always turns up trumps in the moment of
        emergency. Here is a letter from one of Gussy&rsquo;s girl admirers;</p>
        <ul class="quote">

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I quote this in full because (dated April 1939) it is interesting as being
        probably the earliest mention of Hitler in the <i>Gem</i>. In the <i>Gem</i> there is also a
        heroic fat boy. Fatty Wynn, as a set-off against Bunter. Vernon-Smith, &ldquo;the
        Bounder of the Remove&rdquo;, a Byronic character, always on the verge of the sack,
        is another great favourite. And even some of the cads probably have their
        following. Loder, for instance, &ldquo;the rotter of the Sixth&rdquo;, is a cad, but he is
        also a highbrow and given to saying sarcastic things about football and the
        team spirit. The boys of the Remove only think him all the more of a cad for
        this, but a certain type of boy would probably identify with him. Even Racke,
        Grooke &amp; Co. are probably admired by small boys who think it diabolically
        wicked to smoke cigarettes. (A frequent question in the correspondence column;
        &ldquo;What brand of cigarettes does Racke smoke?&rdquo;)</p>
        <p>Naturally the politics of the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> are Conservative, but in a
        completely pre-1914 style, with no Fascist tinge. In reality their basic
        political assumptions are two: nothing ever changes, and foreigners are funny.
        In the <i>Gem</i> of 1939 Frenchmen are still Froggies and Italians are still Dagoes.
        Mossoo, the French master at Greyfriars, is the usual comic-paper Frog, with
        pointed beard, pegtop trousers, etc. Inky, the Indian boy, though a rajah, and
        therefore possessing snob-appeal, is also the comic babu of the <i>Punch</i>
        tradition. (&ldquo;The rowfulness is not the proper caper, my esteemed Bob,&rdquo; said
        Inky. &ldquo;Let dogs delight in the barkfulness and bitefulness, but the soft answer
        is the cracked pitcher that goes longest to a bird in the bush, as the English
        proverb remarks.&rdquo;) Fisher T. Fish is the old-style stage Yankee (&ldquo;Waal, I
        guess&rdquo;, etc.) dating from a peroid of Anglo-American jealousy. Wun Lung, the
        Chinese boy (he has rather faded out of late, no doubt because some of the
        <i>Magnet&rsquo;s</i> readers are Straits Chinese), is the nineteenth-century pantomime
        Chinaman, with saucer-shaped hat, pigtail and pidgin-English. The assumption
        all along is not only that foreigners are comics who are put there for us to
        laugh at, but that they can be classified in much the same way as insects. That
        is why in all boys&rsquo; papers, not only the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>, a Chinese is
        invariably portrayed with a pigtail. It is the thing you recognize him by, like
        the Frenchman&rsquo;s beard or the Italian&rsquo;s barrel-organ. In papers of this kind it
        occasionally happens that when the setting of a story is in a foreign country
        some attempt is made to describe the natives as individual human beings, but as
        a rule it is assumed that foreigners of any one race are all alike and will
        conform more or less exactly to the following patterns:</p>
        <ul class="poetry">
          <li class="poetry-line"><i>Frenchman</i>: Excitable. Wears beard, gesticulates wildly.</li>
          <li class="poetry-line"><i>Spaniard, Mexican, etc.</i>: Sinister, treacherous.</li>
          <li class="poetry-line"><i>Arab, Afghan, etc.</i>: Sinister, treacherous.</li>
          <li class="poetry-line"><i>Chinese</i>: Sinister, treacherous. Wears pigtail.</li>
          <li class="poetry-line"><i>Italian</i>: Excitable. Grinds barrel-organ or carries stiletto.</li>
          <li class="poetry-line"><i>Swede, Dane, etc.</i>: Kind-hearted, stupid.</li>
          <li class="poetry-line"><i>Negro</i>: Comic, very faithful.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The working classes only enter into the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> as comics or
        semi-villains (race-course touts, etc.). As for class-friction, trade unionism,
        strikes, slumps, unemployment, Fascism and civil war&ndash;not a mention.
        Somewhere or other in the thirty years&rsquo; issue of the two papers you might
        perhaps find the word &ldquo;Socialism&rdquo;, but you would have to look a long time for
        it. If the Russian Revolution is anywhere referred to, it will be indirectly,
        in the word &ldquo;Bolshy&rdquo; (meaning a person of violent disagreeable habits). Hitler
        and the Nazis are just beginning to make their appearance, in the sort of
        reference I quoted above. The war-crisis of September 1938 made just enough
        impression to produce a story in which Mr Vernon-Smith, the Bounder&rsquo;s
        millionaire father, cashed in on the general panic by buying up country houses
        in order to sell them to &ldquo;crisis scuttlers&rdquo;. But that is probably as near to
        noticing the European situation as the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> will come, until the war
        actually starts. That does not mean that these papers are
        unpatriotic&ndash;quite the contrary! Throughout the Great War the <i>Gem</i> and
        <i>Magnet</i> were perhaps the most consistently and cheerfully patriotic papers in
        England. Almost every week the boys caught a spy or pushed a conchy into the
        army, and during the rationing period &ldquo;<i>Eat Less Bread</i></i>&rdquo; was printed in large
        type on every page. But their patriotism has nothing whatever to do with
        power-politics or &ldquo;ideological&rdquo; warfare. It is more akin to family loyalty, and
        actually it gives one a valuable clue to the attitude of ordinary people,
        especially the huge untouched block of the middle class and the better-off
        working class. These people are patriotic to the middle of their bones, but
        they do not feel that what happens in foreign countries is any of their
        business. When England is in danger they rally to its defence as a matter of
        course, but in between-times they are not interested. After all, England is
        always in the right and England always wins, so why worry? It is an attitude
        that has been shaken during the past twenty years, but not so deeply as is
        sometimes supposed. Failure to understand it is one of the reasons why Left
        Wing political parties are seldom able to produce an acceptable foreign
        policy.</p>
        <p>The mental world of the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>, therefore, is something like
        this:</p>
        <p>The year is 1910&ndash;or 1940, but it is all the same. You are at
        Greyfriars, a rosy-cheeked boy of fourteen in posh tailor-made clothes, sitting
        down to tea in your study on the Remove passage after an exciting game of
        football which was won by an odd goal in the last half-minute. There is a cosy
        fire in the study, and outside the wind is whistling. The ivy clusters thickly
        round the old grey stones. The King is on his throne and the pound is worth a
        pound. Over in Europe the comic foreigners are jabbering and gesticulating, but
        the grim grey battleships of the British Fleet are steaming up the Channel and
        at the outposts of Empire the monocled Englishmen are holding the niggers at
        bay. Lord Mauleverer has just got another fiver and we are all settling down to
        a tremendous tea of sausages, sardines, crumpets, potted meat, jam and
        doughnuts. After tea we shall sit round the study fire having a good laugh at
        Billy Bunter and discussing the team for next week&rsquo;s match against Rook-wood.
        Everything is safe, solid and unquestionable. Everything will be the same for
        ever and ever. That approximately is the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>But now turn from the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> to the more up-to-date papers which
        have appeared since the Great War. The truly significant thing is that they
        have more points of resemblance to the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> than points of
        difference. But it is better to consider the differences first.</p>
        <p>There are eight of these newer papers, the <i>Modern Boy</i>, <i>Triumph</i>, <i>Champion</i>,
        <i>Wizard</i>, <i>Rover</i>, <i>Skipper</i>, <i>Hotspur</i> and <i>Adventure</i>. All of these have appeared since
        the Great War, but except for the <i>Modern Boy</i> none of them is less than five
        years old. Two papers which ought also to be mentioned briefly here; though
        they are not strictly in the same class as the rest, are the <i>Detective Weekly</i>
        and the <i>Thriller</i>, both owned by the Amalgamated Press. The <i>Detective Weekly</i> has
        taken over Sexton Blake. Both of these papers admit a certain amount of
        sex-interest into their stories, and though certainly read by boys; they are
        not aimed at them exclusively. All the others are boys&rsquo; papers pure and simple,
        and they are sufficiently alike to be considered together. There does not seem
        to be any notable difference between Thomson&rsquo;s publications and those of the
        Amalgamated Press.</p>
        <p>As soon as one looks at these papers one sees their technical superiority to
        the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>. To begin with, they have the great advantage of not being
        written entirely by one person. Instead of one long complete story, a number of
        the <i>Wizard</i> or <i>Hotspur</i> consists of half a dozen or more serials, none of which
        goes on for ever. Consequently there is far more variety and far less padding,
        and none of the tiresome stylization and facetiousness of the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>.
        Look at these two extracts, for example:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li class="quote-text">
          <p>Billy Bunter groaned.</p>
          <p>A quarter of an hour had elapsed out of the two hours that Bunter was booked
          for extra French.</p>
          <p>In a quarter of an hour there were only fifteen minutes! But every one of
          those minutes seemed inordinately long to Bunter. They seemed to crawl by like
          tired snails.</p>
          <p>Looking at the clock in Classroom No. 10 the fat Owl could hardly believe
          that only fifteen minutes had passed. It seemed more like fifteen hours, if not
          fifteen days!</p>
          <p>Other fellows were in extra French as well as Bunter. They did not matter.
          Bunter did! </p>

          of the way up. Sergeant Lionheart Logan of the Mounties was now clinging like a
          human fly to the face of an icy cliff, as smooth and treacherous as a giant
          pane of glass.</p>
          <p>An Arctic blizzard, in all its fury, was buffeting his body, driving the
          blinding snow into his face, seeking to tear his fingers loose from their
          handholds and dash him to death on the jagged boulders which lay at the foot of
          the cliff a hundred feet below.</p>
          <p>Crouching among those boulders were eleven villainous trappers who had done
          their best to shoot down Lionheart and his companion, Constable Jim
          Rogers&ndash;until the blizzard had blotted the two Mounties out of sight from
          below.</p>
          <li class="quote-source">(The Wizard)</li>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The second extract gets you some distance with the story, the first takes a
        hundred words to tell you that Bunter is in the detention class. Moreover, by
        not concentrating on school stories (in point of numbers the school story
        slightly predominates in all these papers, except the <i>Thriller</i> and <i>Detective
        Weekly</i>), the <i>Wizard</i>, <i>Hotspur</i>, etc., have far greater opportunities for
        sensationalism. Merely looking at the cover illustrations of the papers which I
        have on the table in front of me, here are some of the things I see. On one a
        cowboy is clinging by his toes to the wing of an aeroplane in mid-air and
        shooting down another aeroplane with his revolver. On another a Chinese is
        swimming for his life down a sewer with a swarm of ravenous-looking rats
        swimming after him. On another an engineer is lighting a stick of dynamite
        while a steel robot feels for him with its claws. On another a man in airman&rsquo;s
        costume is fighting barehanded against a rat somewhat larger than a donkey. On
        another a nearly naked man of terrific muscular development has just seized a
        lion by the tail and flung it thirty yards over the wall of an arena, with the
        words, &ldquo;Take back your blooming lion!&rdquo; Clearly no school story can compete with
        this kind of thing. From time to time the school buildings may catch fire or
        the French master may turn out to be the head of an international anarchist
        gang, but in a general way the interest must centre round cricket, school
        rivalries, practical jokes, etc. There is not much room for bombs, death-rays,
        sub-machine guns, aeroplanes, mustangs, octopuses, grizzly bears or
        gangsters.</p>
        <p>Examination of a large number of these papers shows that, putting aside
        school stories, the favourite subjects are Wild West, Frozen North, Foreign
        Legion, crime (always from the detective&rsquo;s angle), the Great War (Air Force or
        Secret Service, not the infantry), the Tarzan motif in varying forms,
        professional football, tropical exploration, historical romance (Robin Hood,
        Cavaliers and Round-heads, etc.) and scientific invention. The Wild West still
        leads, at any rate as a setting, though the Red Indian seems to be fading out.
        The one theme that is really new is the scientific one. Death-rays, Martians,
        invisible men, robots, helicopters and interplanetary rockets figure largely:
        here and there there are even far-off rumours of psychotherapy and ductless
        glands. Whereas the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> derive from Dickens and Kipling, the <i>Wizard</i>,
        <i>Champion</i>, <i>Modern Boy</i>, etc., owe a great deal to H. G. Wells, who, rather than
        Jules Verne, is the father of &ldquo;Scientifiction&rdquo;. Naturally it is the magical
        Martian aspect of science that is most exploited, but one or two papers include
        serious articles on scientific subjects, besides quantities of informative
        snippets. (Examples: &ldquo;A Kauri tree in Queensland, Australia, is over 12,000
        years old&rdquo;; &ldquo;Nearly 50,000 thunderstorms occur every day&rdquo;; &ldquo;Helium gas costs
        &pound;1 per 1000 cubic feet&rdquo;; &ldquo;There are over 500 varieties of spiders in
        Great Britain&rdquo;; &ldquo;London firemen use 14,000,000 gallons of water annually&rdquo;,
        etc., etc.) There is a marked advance in intellectual curiosity and, on the
        whole, in the demand made on the reader&rsquo;s attention. In practice the <i>Gem</i> and
        <i>Magnet</i> and the post-war papers are read by much the same public, but the mental
        age aimed at seems to have risen by a year or two years&ndash;an improvement
        probably corresponding to the improvement in elementary education since
        1909.</p>
        <p>The other thing that has emerged in the post-war boys&rsquo; papers, though not to
        anything like the extent one would expect, is bully-worship and the cult of
        violence.</p>
        <p>If one compares the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> with a genuinely modern paper, the thing
        that immediately strikes one is the absence of the leader-principle. There is
        no central dominating character; instead there are fifteen or twenty
        characters, all more or less on an equality, with whom readers of different
        types can identify. In the more modern papers this is not usually the case.
        Instead of identifying with a schoolboy of more or less his own age, the reader
        of the <i>Skipper</i>, <i>Hotspur</i>, etc., is led to identify with a G-man, with a Foreign
        Legionary, with some variant of Tarzan, with an air ace, a master spy, an
        explorer, a pugilist&ndash;at any rate with some single all-powerful character
        who dominates everyone about him and whose usual method of solving any problem
        is a sock on the jaw. This character is intended as a superman, and as physical
        strength is the form of power that boys can best understand, he is usually a
        sort of human gorilla; in the Tarzan type of story he is sometimes actually a
        giant, eight or ten feet high. At the same time the scenes of violence in
        nearly all these stories are remarkably harmless and unconvincing. There is a
        great difference in tone between even the most bloodthirsty English paper and
        the threepenny Yank Mags, <i>Fight Stories</i>, <i>Action Stories</i>, etc. (not strictly
        boys&rsquo; papers, but largely read by boys). In the Yank Mags you get real
        blood-lust, really gory descriptions of the all-in, jump-on-his-testicles style
        fighting, written in a jargon that has been perfected by people who brood
        endlessly on violence. A paper like <i>Fight Stories</i>, for instance, would have
        very little appeal except to sadists and masochists. You can see the
        comparative gentleness of the English civilization by the amateurish way in
        which prize-fighting is always described in the boys&rsquo; weeklies. There is no
        specialized vocabulary. Look at these four extracts, two English, two
        American;</p>

        <p>Notice how much more knowledgeable the American extracts sound. They are
        written for devotees of the prize-ring, the others are not. Also, it ought to
        be emphasized that on its level the moral code of the English boys&rsquo; papers is a
        decent one. Crime and dishonesty are never held up to admiration, there is none
        of the cynicism and corruption of the American gangster story. The huge sale of
        the Yank Mags in England shows that there is a demand for that kind of thing,
        but very few English writers seem able to produce it. When hatred of Hitler
        became a major emotion in America, it was interesting to see how promptly
        &ldquo;anti-Fascism&rdquo; was adapted to pornographic purposes by the editors of the Yank
        Mags. One magazine which I have in front of me is given up to a long, complete
        story, &ldquo;When Hell Game to America&rdquo;, in which the agents of a &ldquo;blood-maddened
        European dictator&rdquo; are trying to conquer the U.S.A. with death-rays and
        invisible aeroplanes. There is the frankest appeal to sadism, scenes in which
        the Nazis tie bombs to women&rsquo;s backs and fling them off heights to watch them
        blown to pieces in mid-air, others in which they tie naked girls together by
        their hair and prod them with knives to make them dance, etc., etc. The editor
        comments solemnly on all this, and uses it as a plea for tightening up
        restrictions against immigrants. On another page of the same paper: &ldquo;<i>Lives of
        the Hotcha Chorus Girls</i>. Reveals all the intimate secrets and fascinating
      pastimes of the famous Broadway Hotcha girls. <i>Nothing is Omitted</i>. Price 10c.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;<i>How to Love</i>. 10c.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>French Photo Ring</i>. 25c.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Naughty Nudies Transfer</i>. From
        the outside of the glass you see a beautiful girl, innocently dressed. Turn it
        around and look through the glass and oh! what a difference! Set of 3 transfers
        25c.,&rdquo; etc., etc., etc. There is nothing at all like this in any English paper
        likely to be read by boys. But the process of Americanization is going on all
        the same. The American ideal, the &ldquo;he-man&rdquo;, the &ldquo;tough guy&rdquo;, the gorilla who
        puts everything right by socking everybody on the jaw, now figures in probably
        a majority of boys&rsquo; papers. In one serial now running in the <i>Skipper</i> he is
        always portrayed ominously enough, swinging a rubber truncheon.</p>
        <p>The development of the <i>Wizard</i>, <i>Hotspur</i>, etc., as against the earlier boys&rsquo;
        papers, boils down to this: better technique, more scientific interest, more
        bloodshed, more leader-worship. But, after all, it is the <i>lack</i> of development
        that is the really striking thing.</p>
        <p>To begin with, there is no political development whatever. The world of the
        <i>Skipper</i> and the <i>Champion</i> is still the pre-1914 world of the <i>Magnet</i> and the <i>Gem</i>.
        The Wild West story, for instance, with its cattle-rustlers, lynch-law and
        other paraphernalia belonging to the eighties, is a curiously archaic thing. It
        is worth noticing that in papers of this type it is always taken for granted
        that adventures only happen at the ends of the earth, in tropical forests, in
        Arctic wastes, in African deserts, on Western prairies, in Chinese opium
        dens&ndash;everywhere in fact, except the places where things really <i>do</i> happen.
        That is a belief dating from thirty or forty years ago, when the new continents
        were in process of being opened up. Nowadays, of course, if you really want
        adventure, the place to look for it is in Europe. But apart from the
        picturesque side of the Great War, contemporary history is carefully excluded.
        And except that Americans are now admired instead of being laughed at,
        foreigners are exactly the same figures of fun that they always were. If a
        Chinese character appears, he is still the sinister pigtailed opium-smuggler of
        Sax Rohmer; no indication that things have been happening in China since
        1912&ndash;no indication that a war is going on there, for instance. If a
        Spaniard appears, he is still a &ldquo;dago&rdquo; or &ldquo;greaser&rdquo; who rolls cigarettes and
        stabs people in the back; no indication that things have been happening in
        Spain. Hitler and the Nazis have not yet appeared, or are barely making their
        appearance. There will be plenty about them in a little while, but it will be
        from a strictly patriotic angle (Britain versus Germany), with the real meaning
        of the struggle kept out of sight as much as possible. As for the Russian
        Revolution, it is extremely difficult to find any reference to it in any of
        these papers. When Russia is mentioned at all it is usually in an information
        snippet (example: &ldquo;There are 29,000 centenarians in the USSR.&rdquo;), and any
        reference to the Revolution is indirect and twenty years out of date. In one
        story in the <i>Rover</i>, for instance, somebody has a tame bear, and as it is a
        Russian bear, it is nicknamed Trotsky&ndash;obviously an echo of the 1917-23
        period and not of recent controversies. The clock has stopped at 1910.
        Britannia rules the waves, and no one has heard of slumps, booms, unemployment,
        dictatorships, purges or concentration camps.</p>
        <p>And in social outlook there is hardly any advance. The snobbishness is
        somewhat less open than in the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>&ndash;that is the most one can
        possibly say. To begin with, the school story, always partly dependent on
        snob-appeal, is by no means eliminated. Every number of a boys&rsquo; paper includes
        at least one school story, these stories slightly outnumbering the Wild
        Westerns. The very elaborate fantasy-life of the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i> is not imitated
        and there is more emphasis on extraneous adventure, but the social atmosphere
        (old grey stones) is much the same. When a new school is introduced at the
        beginning of a story we are often told in just those words that &ldquo;it was a very
        posh school&rdquo;. From time to time a story appears which is ostensibly directed
        <i>against</i> snobbery. The scholarship-boy (cf. Tom Redwing in the <i>Magnet</i>) makes
        fairly frequent appearances, and what is essentially the same theme is
        sometimes presented in this form: there is great rivalry between two schools,
        one of which considers itself more &ldquo;posh&rdquo; than the other, and there are fights,
        practical jokes, football matches, etc., always ending in the discomfiture of
        the snobs. If one glances very superficially at some of these stories it is
        possible to imagine that a democratic spirit has crept into the boys&rsquo; weeklies,
        but when one looks more closely one sees that they merely reflect the bitter
        jealousies that exist within the white-collar class. Their real function is to
        allow the boy who goes to a cheap private school (<i>not</i> a Council school) to feel
        that his school is just as &ldquo;posh&rdquo; in the sight of God as Winchester or Eton.
        The sentiment of school loyalty (&ldquo;We&rsquo;re better than the fellows down the
        road&rdquo;), a thing almost unknown to the real working class, is still kept up. As
        these stories are written by many different hands, they do, of course, vary a
        good deal in tone. Some are reasonably free from snobbishness, in others money
        and pedigree are exploited even more shamelessly than in the <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>. In
        one that I came across an actual <i>majority</i> of the boys mentioned were
        titled.</p>
        <p>Where working-class characters appear, it is usually either as comics (jokes
        about tramps, convicts, etc.), or as prize-fighters, acrobats, cowboys,
        professional footballers and Foreign Legionaries&ndash;in other words, as
        adventurers. There is no facing of the facts about working-class life, or,
        indeed, about <i>working</i> life of any description. Very occasionally one may come
        across a realistic description of, say, work in a coal-mine, but in all
        probability it will only be there as the background of some lurid adventure. In
        any case the central character is not likely to be a coal-miner. Nearly all the
        time the boy who reads these papers&ndash;in nine cases out often a boy who is
        going to spend his life working in a shop, in a factory or in some subordinate
        job in an office&ndash;is led to identify with people in positions of command,
        above all with people who are never troubled by shortage of money. The Lord
        Peter Wimsey figure, the seeming idiot who drawls and wears a monocle but is
        always to the fore in moments of danger, turns up over and over again. (This
        character is a great favourite in Secret Service stories.) And, as usual, the
        heroic characters all have to talk B.B.C.; they may talk Scottish or Irish or
        American, but no one in a star part is ever permitted to drop an aitch. Here it
        is worth comparing the social atmosphere of the boys&rsquo; weeklies with that of the
        women&rsquo;s weeklies, the <i>Oracle</i>, the <i>Family Star</i>, <i>Peg&rsquo;s Paper</i>, etc.</p>
        <p>The women&rsquo;s papers are aimed at an older public and are read for the most
        part by girls who are working for a living. Consequently they are on the
        surface much more realistic. It is taken for granted, for example, that nearly
        everyone has to live in a big town and work at a more or less dull job. Sex, so
        far from being taboo, is <i>the</i> subject. The short, complete stories, the special
        feature of these papers, are generally of the &ldquo;came the dawn&rdquo; type: the heroine
        narrowly escapes losing her &ldquo;boy&rdquo; to a designing rival, or the &ldquo;boy&rdquo; loses his
        job and has to postpone marriage, but presently gets a better job. The
        changeling-fantasy (a girl brought up in a poor home is &ldquo;really&rdquo; the child of
        rich parents) is another favourite. Where sensationalism comes in, usually in
        the serials, it arises out of the more domestic type of crime, such as bigamy,
        forgery or sometimes murder; no Martians, death-rays or international anarchist
        gangs. These papers are at any rate aiming at credibility, and they have a link
        with real life in their correspondence columns, where genuine problems are
        being discussed. Ruby M. Ayres&rsquo;s column of advice in the <i>Oracle</i>, for instance,
        is extremely sensible and well written. And yet the world of the <i>Oracle</i> and
        <i>Peg&rsquo;a Paper</i> is a pure fantasy-world. It is the same fantasy all the time;
        pretending to be richer than you are. The chief impression that one carries
        away from almost every story in these papers is of a frightful, overwhelming
        &ldquo;refinement&rdquo;. Ostensibly the characters are working-class people, but their
        habits, the interiors of their houses, their clothes, their outlook and, above
        all, their speech are entirely middle class. They are all living at several
        pounds a week above their income. And needless to say, that is just the
        impression that is intended. The idea is to give the bored factory-girl or
        worn-out mother of five a dream-life in which she pictures herself&ndash;not
        actually as a duchess (that convention has gone out) but as, say, the wife of a
        bank-manager. Not only is a five-to-six-pound-a-week standard of life set up as
        the ideal, but it is tacitly assumed that that is how working-class people
        really <i>do</i> live. The major facts are simply not faced. It is admitted, for
        instance, that people sometimes lose their jobs; but then the dark clouds roll
        away and they get better jobs instead. No mention of un-employment as something
        permanent and inevitable, no mention of the dole, no mention of trade unionism.
        No suggestion anywhere that there can be anything wrong with the system <i>as a
        system</i>; there are only individual misfortunes, which are generally due to
        somebody&rsquo;s wickedness and can in any case be put right in the last chapter.
        Always the dark clouds roll away, the kind employer raises Alfred&rsquo;s wages, and
        there are jobs for everybody except the drunks. It is still the world of the
        <i>Wizard</i> and the <i>Gem</i>, except that there are orange-blossoms instead of
        machine-guns.</p>
        <p>The outlook inculcated by all these papers is that of a rather exceptionally
        stupid member of the Navy League in the year 1910. Yes, it may be said, but
        what does it matter? And in any case, what else do you expect?</p>
        <p>Of course no one in his senses would want to turn the so-called penny
        dreadful into a realistic novel or a Socialist tract. An adventure story must
        of its nature be more or less remote from real life. But, as I have tried to
        make clear, the unreality of the <i>Wizard</i> and the <i>Gem</i> is not so artless as it
        looks. These papers exist because of a specialized demand, because boys at
        certain ages find it necessary to read about Martians, death-rays, grizzly
        bears and gangsters. They get what they are looking for, but they get it
        wrapped up in the illusions which their future employers think suitable for
        them. To what extent people draw their ideas from fiction is disputable.
        Personally I believe that most people are influenced far more than they would
        care to admit by novels, serial stories, films and so forth, and that from this
        point of view the worst books are often the most important, because they are
        usually the ones that are read earliest in life. It is probable that many
        people who would consider themselves extremely sophisticated and &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; are
        actually carrying through life an imaginative background which they acquired in
        childhood from (for instance) Sapper and Ian Hay. If that is so, the boys&rsquo;
        twopenny weeklies are of the deepest importance. Here is the stuff that is read
        somewhere between the ages of twelve and eighteen by a very large proportion,
        perhaps an actual majority, of English boys, including many who will never read
        anything else except newspapers; and along with it they are absorbing a set of
        beliefs which would be regarded as hopelessly out of date in the Central Office
        of the Conservative Party. All the better because it is done indirectly, there
        is being pumped into them the conviction that the major problems of our time do
        not exist, that there is nothing wrong with <i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism, that
        foreigners are un-important comics and that the British Empire is a sort of
        charity-concern which will last for ever. Considering who owns these papers, it
        is difficult to believe that this is un-intentional. Of the twelve papers I
        have been discussing (i.e. twelve including the <i>Thriller</i> and <i>Detective Weekly</i>)
        seven are the property of the Amalgamated Press, which is one of the biggest
        press-combines in the world and controls more than a hundred different papers.
        The <i>Gem</i> and <i>Magnet</i>, therefore, are closely linked up with the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>
        and the <i>Financial Times</i>. This in itself would be enough to rouse certain
        suspicions, even if it were not obvious that the stories in the boys&rsquo; weeklies
        are politically vetted. So it appears that if you feel the need of a
        fantasy-life in which you travel to Mars and fight lions bare-handed (and what
        boy doesn&rsquo;t?), you can only have it by delivering yourself over, mentally, to
        people like Lord Camrose. For there is no competition. Throughout the whole of
        this run of papers the differences are negligible, and on this level no others
        exist. This raises the question, why is there no such thing as a left-wing
        boys&rsquo; paper?</p>
        <p>At first glance such an idea merely makes one slightly sick. It is so
        horribly easy to imagine what a left-wing boys&rsquo; paper would be like, if it
        existed. I remember in 1920 or 1921 some optimistic person handing round
        Communist tracts among a crowd of public-school boys. The tract I received was
        of the question-and-answer kind:</p>
        <ul class="poetry">
          <li class="poetry-line">Q. &ldquo;Can a Boy Communist be a Boy Scout, Comrade?&rdquo;</li>
          <li class="poetry-line">A. &ldquo;No, Comrade.&rdquo;</li>
          <li class="poetry-line">Q. &ldquo;Why, Comrade?&rdquo;</li>
          <li class="poetry-line">A. &ldquo;Because, Comrade, a Boy Scout must salute the Union Jack, which is
          the symbol of tyranny and oppression,&rdquo; etc., etc.</li>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now suppose that at this moment somebody started a left-wing paper
        deliberately aimed at boys of twelve or fourteen. I do not suggest that the
        whole of its contents would be exactly like the tract I have quoted above, but
        does anyone doubt that they would be <i>something</i> like it? Inevitably such a paper
        would either consist of dreary up-lift or it would be under Communist influence
        and given over to adulation of Soviet Russia; in either case no normal boy
        would ever look at it. Highbrow literature apart, the whole of the existing
        left-wing Press, in so far as it is at all vigorously &ldquo;left&rdquo;, is one long
        tract. The one Socialist paper in England which could live a week on its merits
        <i>as a paper</i> is the <i>Daily Herald</i>: and how much Socialism is there in the 
        <i>Daily Herald</i>? At this moment, therefore, a paper with a &ldquo;left&rdquo; slant and at the same
        time likely to have an appeal to ordinary boys in their teens is something
        almost beyond hoping for.</p>
        <p>But it does not follow that it is impossible. There is no clear reason why
        every adventure story should necessarily be mixed up with snobbishness and
        gutter patriotism. For, after all, the stories in the <i>Hotspur</i> and the 
        <i>Modern Boy</i> are not Conservative tracts; they are merely adventure stories with a
        Conservative bias. It is fairly easy to imagine the process being reversed. It
        is possible, for instance, to imagine a paper as thrilling and lively as the
        <i>Hotspur</i>, but with subject-matter and &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; a little more up to date. It is
        even possible (though this raises other difficulties) to imagine a women&rsquo;s
        paper at the same literary level as the <i>Oracle</i>, dealing in approximately the
        same kind of story, but taking rather more account of the realities of
        working-class life. Such things have been done before, though not in England.
        In the last years of the Spanish monarchy there was a large output in Spain of
        left-wing novelettes, some of them evidently of anarchist origin. Unfortunately
        at the time when they were appearing I did not see their social significance,
        and I lost the collection of them that I had, but no doubt copies would still
        be procurable. In get-up and style of story they were very similar to the
        English fourpenny novelette, except that their inspiration was &ldquo;left&rdquo;. If, for
        instance, a story described police pursuing anarchists through the mountains,
        it would be from the point of view of the anarchist and not of the police. An
        example nearer to hand is the Soviet film <i>Chapaiev</i>, which has been shown a
        number of times in London. Technically, by the standards of the time when it
        was made, <i>Chapaiev</i> is a first-rate film, but mentally, in spite of the
        unfamiliar Russian background, it is not so very remote from Hollywood. The one
        thing that lifts it out of the ordinary is the remarkable performance by the
        actor who takes the part of the White officer (the fat one)&ndash;a performance
        which looks very like an inspired piece of gagging. Otherwise the atmosphere is
        familiar. All the usual paraphernalia is there&ndash;heroic fight against odds,
        escape at the last moment, shots of galloping horses, love interest, comic
        relief. The film is in fact a fairly ordinary one, except that its tendency is
        &ldquo;left&rdquo;. In a Hollywood film of the Russian Civil War the Whites would probably
        be angels and the Reds demons. In the Russian version the Reds are angels and
        the Whites demons. That is also a lie, but, taking the long view, it is a less
        pernicious lie than the other.</p>
        <p>Here several difficult problems present themselves. Their general nature is
        obvious enough, and I do not want to discuss them. I am merely pointing to the
        fact that, in England, popular imaginative literature is a field that left-wing
        thought has never begun to enter. <i>All</i> fiction from the novels in the mushroom
        libraries downwards is censored in the interests of the ruling class. And boys&rsquo;
        fiction above all, the blood-and-thunder stuff which nearly every boy devours
        at some time or other, is sodden in the worst illusions of 1910. The fact is
        only unimportant if one believes that what is read in childhood leaves no
        impression behind. Lord Camrose and his colleagues evidently believe nothing of
        the kind, and, after all, Lord Camrose ought to know.</p>
