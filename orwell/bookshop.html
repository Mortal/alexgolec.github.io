        When I worked in a second-hand bookshop&ndash;so easily pictured, if you
        don&rsquo;t work in one, as a kind of paradise where charming old gentlemen browse
        eternally among calf-bound folios&ndash;the thing that chiefly struck me was
        the rarity of really bookish people. Our shop had an exceptionally interesting
        stock, yet I doubt whether ten per cent of our customers knew a good book from
        a bad one. First edition snobs were much commoner than lovers of literature,
        but oriental students haggling over cheap textbooks were commoner still, and
        vague-minded women looking for birthday presents for their nephews were
        commonest of all.</p>
        <p>Many of the people who came to us were of the kind who would be a nuisance
        anywhere but have special opportunities in a bookshop. For example, the dear
        old lady who &ldquo;wants a book for an invalid&rdquo; (a very common demand, that), and
        the other dear old lady who read such a nice book in 1897 and wonders whether
        you can find her a copy. Unfortunately she doesn&rsquo;t remember the title or the
        author&rsquo;s name or what the book was about, but she does remember that it had a
        red cover. But apart from these there are two well-known types of pest by whom
        every second-hand bookshop is haunted. One is the decayed person smelling of
        old bread-crusts who comes every day, sometimes several times a day, and tries
        to sell you worthless books. The other is the person who orders large
        quantities of books for which he has not the smallest intention of paying. In
        our shop we sold nothing on credit, but we would put books aside, or order them
        if necessary, for people who arranged to fetch them away later. Scarcely half
        the people who ordered books from us ever came back. It used to puzzle me at
        first. What made them do it? They would come in and demand some rare and
        expensive book, would make us promise over and over again to keep it for them,
        and then would vanish never to return. But many of them, of course, were
        unmistakable paranoiacs. They used to talk in a grandiose manner about
        themselves and tell the most ingenious stories to explain how they had happened
        to come out of doors without any money&ndash;stories which, in many cases, I am
        sure they themselves believed. In a town like London there are always plenty of
        not quite certifiable lunatics walking the streets, and they tend to gravitate
        towards bookshops, because a bookshop is one of the few places where you can
        hang about for a long time without spending any money. In the end one gets to
        know these people almost at a glance. For all their big talk there is something
        moth-eaten and aimless about them. Very often, when we were dealing with an
        obvious paranoiac, we would put aside the books he asked for and then put them
        back on the shelves the moment he had gone. None of them, I noticed, ever
        attempted to take books away without paying for them; merely to order them was
        enough&ndash;it gave them, I suppose, the illusion that they were spending real
        money.</p>
        <p>Like most second-hand bookshops we had various sidelines. We sold
        second-hand typewriters, for instance, and also stamps&ndash;used stamps, I
        mean. Stamp-collectors are a strange, silent, fish-like breed, of all ages, but
        only of the male sex; women, apparently, fail to see the peculiar charm of
        gumming bits of coloured paper into albums. We also sold sixpenny horoscopes
        compiled by somebody who claimed to have foretold the Japanese earthquake. They
        were in sealed envelopes and I never opened one of them myself, but the people
        who bought them often came back and told us how &ldquo;true&rdquo; their horoscopes had
        been. (Doubtless any horoscope seems &ldquo;true&rdquo; if it tells you that you are highly
        attractive to the opposite sex and your worst fault is generosity.) We did a
        good deal of business in children&rsquo;s books, chiefly &ldquo;remainders&rdquo;. Modern books
        for children are rather horrible things, especially when you see them in the
        mass. Personally I would sooner give a child a copy of Petronius Arbiter than
        <i>Peter Pan</i>, but even Barrie seems manly and wholesome compared with some of his
        later imitators. At Christmas time we spent a feverish ten days struggling with
        Christmas cards and calendars, which are tiresome things to sell but good
        business while the season lasts. It used to interest me to see the brutal
        cynicism with which Christian sentiment is exploited. The touts from the
        Christmas card firms used to come round with their catalogues as early as June.
        A phrase from one of their invoices sticks in my memory. It was: &ldquo;2 doz. Infant
        Jesus with rabbits&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>But our principal sideline was a lending library&ndash;the usual &ldquo;twopenny
        no-deposit&rdquo; library of five or six hundred volumes, all fiction. How the book
        thieves must love those libraries! It is the easiest crime in the world to
        borrow a book at one shop for twopence, remove the label and sell it at another
        shop for a shilling. Nevertheless booksellers generally find that it pays them
        better to have a certain number of books stolen (we used to lose about a dozen
        a month) than to frighten customers away by demanding a deposit.</p>
        <p>Our shop stood exactly on the frontier between Hampstead and Camden Town,
        and we were frequented by all types from baronets to bus-conductors. Probably
        our library subscribers were a fair cross-section of London&rsquo;s reading public.
        It is therefore worth noting that of all the authors in our library the one who
        &ldquo;went out&rdquo; the best was&ndash;Priestley? Hemingway? Walpole? Wodehouse? No,
        Ethel M. Dell, with Warwick Deeping a good second and Jeffrey Farnol, I should
        say, third. Dell&rsquo;s novels, of course, are read solely by women, but by women of
        all kinds and ages and not, as one might expect, merely by wistful spinsters
        and the fat wives of tobacconists. It is not true that men don&rsquo;t read novels,
        but it is true that there are whole branches of fiction that they avoid.
        Roughly speaking, what one might call the <i>average</i> novel&ndash;the ordinary,
        good-bad, Galsworthy-and-water stuff which is the norm of the English
        novel&ndash;seems to exist only for women. Men read either the novels it is
        possible to respect, or detective stories. But their consumption of detective
        stories is terrific. One of our subscribers to my knowledge read four or five
        detective stories every week for over a year, besides others which he got from
        another library. What chiefly surprised me was that he never read the same book
        twice. Apparently the whole of that frightful torrent of trash (the pages read
        every year would, I calculated, cover nearly three quarters of an acre) was
        stored for ever in his memory. He took no notice of titles or author&rsquo;s names,
        but he could tell by merely glancing into a book whether be had &ldquo;had it
        already&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>In a lending library you see people&rsquo;s real tastes, not their pretended ones,
        and one thing that strikes you is how completely the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; English
        novelists have dropped out of favour. It is simply useless to put Dickens,
        Thackeray, Jane Austen, Trollope, etc. into the ordinary lending library;
        nobody takes them out. At the mere sight of a nineteenth-century novel people
        say, &ldquo;Oh, but that&rsquo;s <i>old</i>!&rdquo; and shy away immediately. Yet it is always fairly
        easy to <i>sell</i> Dickens, just as it is always easy to sell Shakespeare. Dickens is
        one of those authors whom people are &ldquo;always meaning to&rdquo; read, and, like the
        Bible, he is widely known at second hand. People know by hearsay that Bill
        Sikes was a burglar and that Mr Micawber had a bald head, just as they know by
        hearsay that Moses was found in a basket of bulrushes and saw the &ldquo;back parts&rdquo;
        of the Lord. Another thing that is very noticeable is the growing unpopularity
        of American books. And another&ndash;the publishers get into a stew about this
        every two or three years&ndash;is the unpopularity of short stories. The kind
        of person who asks the librarian to choose a book for him nearly always starts
        by saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want short stories&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I do not desire little stories&rdquo;, as
        a German customer of ours used to put it. If you ask them why, they sometimes
        explain that it is too much fag to get used to a new set of characters with
        every story; they like to &ldquo;get into&rdquo; a novel which demands no further thought
        after the first chapter. I believe, though, that the writers are more to blame
        here than the readers. Most modern short stories, English and American, are
        utterly lifeless and worthless, far more so than most novels. The short stories
        which are stories are popular enough, <i>vide</i> D. H. Lawrence, whose short stories
        are as popular as his novels.</p>
        <p>Would I like to be a bookseller <i> De M&eacute;tier</i>? On the whole&ndash;in
        spite of my employer&rsquo;s kindness to me, and some happy days I spent in the
        shop&ndash;no.</p>
        <p>Given a good pitch and the right amount of capital, any educated person
        ought to be able to make a small secure living out of a bookshop. Unless one
        goes in for &ldquo;rare&rdquo; books it is not a difficult trade to learn, and you start at
        a great advantage if you know anything about the insides of books. (Most
        booksellers don&rsquo;t. You can get their measure by having a look at the trade
        papers where they advertise their wants. If you don&rsquo;t see an ad. for Boswell&rsquo;s
        <i>Decline and Fall</i> you are pretty sure to see one for <i>The Mill on the Floss</i> by T.
        S. Eliot.) Also it is a humane trade which is not capable of being vulgarized
        beyond a certain point. The combines can never squeeze the small independent
        bookseller out of existence as they have squeezed the grocer and the milkman.
        But the hours of work are very long&ndash;I was only a part-time employee, but
        my employer put in a seventy-hour week, apart from constant expeditions out of
        hours to buy books&ndash;and it is an unhealthy life. As a rule a bookshop is
        horribly cold in winter, because if it is too warm the windows get misted over,
        and a bookseller lives on his windows. And books give off more and nastier dust
        than any other class of objects yet invented, and the top of a book is the
        place where every bluebottle prefers to die.</p>
        <p>But the real reason why I should not like to be in the book trade for life
        is that while I was in it I lost my love of books. A bookseller has to tell
        lies about books, and that gives him a distaste for them; still worse is the
        fact that he is constantly dusting them and hauling them to and fro. There was
        a time when I really did love books&ndash;loved the sight and smell and feel of
        them, I mean, at least if they were fifty or more years old. Nothing pleased me
        quite so much as to buy a job lot of them for a shilling at a country auction.
        There is a peculiar flavour about the battered unexpected books you pick up in
        that kind of collection: minor eighteenth-century poets, out-of-date gazeteers,
        odd volumes of forgotten novels, bound numbers of ladies&rsquo; magazines of the
        sixties. For casual reading&ndash;in your bath, for instance, or late at night
        when you are too tired to go to bed, or in the odd quarter of an hour before
        lunch&ndash;there is nothing to touch a back number of the <i>Girl&rsquo;s Own Paper</i>.
        But as soon as I went to work in the bookshop I stopped buying books. Seen in
        the mass, five or ten thousand at a time, books were boring and even slightly
        sickening. Nowadays I do buy one occasionally, but only if it is a book that I
        want to read and can&rsquo;t borrow, and I never buy junk. The sweet smell of
        decaying paper appeals to me no longer. It is too closely associated in my mind
        with paranoiac customers and dead bluebottles.</p>
