        As the corpse went past the flies left the restaurant table in a cloud and
        rushed after it, but they came back a few minutes later.</p>
        <p>The little crowd of mourners-all men and boys, no women&ndash;threaded their
        way across the market-place between the piles of pomegranates and the taxis and
        the camels, wailing a short chant over and over again. What really appeals to
        the flies is that the corpses here are never put into coffins, they are merely
        wrapped in a piece of rag and carried on a rough wooden bier on the shoulders
        of four friends. When the friends get to the burying-ground they hack an oblong
        hole a foot or two deep, dump the body in it and fling over it a little of the
        dried-up, lumpy earth, which is like broken brick. No gravestone, no name, no
        identifying mark of any kind. The burying-ground is merely a huge waste of
        hummocky earth, like a derelict building-lot. After a month or two no one can
        even be certain where his own relatives are buried.</p>
        <p>When you walk through a town like this&ndash;two hundred thousand
        inhabitants, of whom at least twenty thousand own literally nothing except the
        rags they stand up in&ndash;when you see how the people live, and still more
        how easily they die, it is always difficult to believe that you are walking
        among human beings. All colonial empires are in reality founded upon that fact.
        The people have brown faces&ndash;besides, there are so many of them! Are they
        really the same flesh as yourself? Do they even have names? Or are they merely
        a kind of undifferentiated brown stuff, about as individual as bees or coral
        insects? They rise out of the earth, they sweat and starve for a few years, and
        then they sink back into the nameless mounds of the graveyard and nobody
        notices that they are gone. And even the graves themselves soon fade back into
        the soil. Sometimes, out for a walk, as you break your way through the prickly
        pear, you notice that it is rather bumpy underfoot, and only a certain
        regularity in the bumps tells you that you are walking over skeletons.</p>
        <p>I was feeding one of the gazelles in the public gardens.</p>
        <p>Gazelles are almost the only animals that look good to eat when they are
        still alive, in fact, one can hardly look at their hindquarters without
        thinking of mint sauce. The gazelle I was feeding seemed to know that this
        thought was in my mind, for though it took the piece of bread I was holding out
        it obviously did not like me. It nibbled rapidly at the bread, then lowered its
        head and tried to butt me, then took another nibble and then butted again.
        Probably its idea was that if it could drive me away the bread would somehow
        remain hanging in mid-air.</p>
        <p>An Arab navvy working on the path nearby lowered his heavy hoe and sidled
        towards us. He looked from the gazelle to the bread and from the bread to the
        gazelle, with a sort of quiet amazement, as though he had never seen anything
        quite like this before. Finally he said shyly in French:</p>
        <p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> could eat some of that bread.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>I tore off a piece and he stowed it gratefully in some secret place under
        his rags. This man is an employee of the Municipality.</p>
        <p>When you go through the Jewish quarters you gather some idea of what the
        medieval ghettoes were probably like. Under their Moorish rulers the Jews were
        only allowed to own land in certain restricted areas, and after centuries of
        this kind of treatment they have ceased to bother about overcrowding. Many of
        the streets are a good deal less than six feet wide, the houses are completely
        windowless, and sore-eyed children cluster everywhere in unbelievable numbers,
        like clouds of flies. Down the centre of the street there is generally running
        a little river of urine.</p>
        <p>In the bazaar huge families of Jews, all dressed in the long black robe and
        little black skull-cap, are working in dark fly-infested booths that look like
        caves. A carpenter sits cross-legged at a prehistoric lathe, turning chair-legs
        at lightning speed. He works the lathe with a bow in his right hand and guides
        the chisel with his left foot, and thanks to a lifetime of sitting in this
        position his left leg is warped out of shape. At his side his grandson, aged
        six, is already starting on the simpler parts of the job.</p>
        <p>I was just passing the coppersmiths&rsquo; booths when somebody noticed that I was
        lighting a cigarette. Instantly, from the dark holes all round, there was a
        frenzied rush of Jews, many of them old grandfathers with flowing grey beards,
        all clamouring for a cigarette. Even a blind man somewhere at the back of one
        of the booths heard a rumour of cigarettes and came crawling out, groping in
        the air with his hand. In about a minute I had used up the whole packet. None
        of these people, I suppose, works less than twelve hours a day, and every one
        of them looks on a cigarette as a more or less impossible luxury.</p>
        <p>As the Jews live in self-contained communities they follow the same trades
        as the Arabs, except for agriculture. Fruit-sellers, potters, silversmiths,
        blacksmiths, butchers, leather-workers, tailors, water-carriers, beggars,
        porters&ndash;whichever way you look you see nothing but Jews. As a matter of
        fact there are thirteen thousand of them, all living in the space of a few
        acres. A good job Hitler isn&rsquo;t here. Perhaps he is on his way, however. You
        hear the usual dark rumours about the Jews, not only from the Arabs but from
        the poorer Europeans.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>min vieux</i>, they took my job away from me and gave it to a Jew. The
        Jews! They&rsquo;re the real rulers of this country, you know. They&rsquo;ve got all the
        money. They control the banks, finance&ndash;everything.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it a fact that the average Jew is a labourer working
        for about a penny an hour?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s only for show! They&rsquo;re all money-lenders really. They&rsquo;re
        cunning, the Jews.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>In just the same way, a couple of hundred years ago, poor old women used to
        be burned for witchcraft when they could not even work enough magic to get
        themselves a square meal.</p>
        <p>All people who work with their hands are partly invisible, and the more
        important the work they do, the less visible they are. Still, a white skin is
        always fairly conspicuous. In northern Europe, when you see a labourer
        ploughing a field, you probably give him a second glance. In a hot country,
        anywhere south of Gibraltar or east of Suez, the chances are that you don&rsquo;t
        even see him. I have noticed this again and again. In a tropical landscape
        one&rsquo;s eye takes in everything except the human beings. It takes in the dried-up
        soil, the prickly pear, the palm-tree and the distant mountain, but it always
        misses the peasant hoeing at his patch. He is the same colour as the earth, and
        a great deal less interesting to look at.</p>
        <p>It is only because of this that the starved countries of Asia and Africa are
        accepted as tourist resorts. No one would think of running cheap trips to the
        Distressed Areas. But where the human beings have brown skins their poverty is
        simply not noticed. What does Morocco mean to a Frenchman? An orange-grove or a
        job in government service. Or to an Englishman? Camels, castles, palm-trees,
        Foreign Legionnaires, brass trays and bandits. One could probably live here for
        years without noticing that for nine-tenths of the people the reality of life
        is an endless, back-breaking struggle to wring a little food out of an eroded
        soil.</p>
        <p>Most of Morocco is so desolate that no wild animal bigger than a hare can
        live on it. Huge areas which were once covered with forest have turned into a
        treeless waste where the soil is exactly like broken-up brick. Nevertheless a
        good deal of it is cultivated, with frightful labour. Everything is done by
        hand. Long lines of women, bent double like inverted capital Ls, work their way
        slowly across the fields, tearing up the prickly weeds with their hands, and
        the peasant gathering lucerne for fodder pulls it up stalk by stalk instead of
        reaping it, thus saving an inch or two on each stalk. The plough is a wretched
        wooden thing, so frail that one can easily carry it on one&rsquo;s shoulder, and
        fitted underneath with a rough iron spike which stirs the soil to a depth of
        about four inches. This is as much as the strength of the animals is equal to.
        It is usual to plough with a cow and a donkey yoked together. Two donkeys would
        not be quite strong enough, but on the other hand two cows would cost a little
        more to feed. The peasants possess no harrows, they merely plough the soil
        several times over in different directions, finally leaving it in rough
        furrows, after which the whole field has to be shaped with hoes into small
        oblong patches, to conserve water. Except for a day or two after the rare
        rainstorms there is never enough water. Along the edges of the fields channels
        are hacked out to a depth of thirty or forty feet to get at the tiny trickles
        which run through the subsoil.</p>
        <p>Every afternoon a file of very old women passes down the road outside my
        house, each carrying a load of firewood. All of them are mummified with age and
        the sun, and all of them are tiny. It seems to be generally the case in
        primitive communities that the women, when they get beyond a certain age,
        shrink to the size of children. One day a poor old creature who could not have
        been more than four feet tall crept past me under a vast load of wood. I
        stopped her and put a five-sou piece (a little more than a farthing) into her
        hand. She answered with a shrill wail, almost a scream, which was partly
        gratitude but mainly surprise. I suppose that from her point of view, by taking
        any notice of her, I seemed almost to be violating a law of nature. She
        accepted her status as an old woman, that is to say as a beast of burden. When
        a family is travelling it is quite usual to see a father and a grown-up son
        riding ahead on donkeys, and an old woman following on foot, carrying the
        baggage.</p>
        <p>But what is strange about these people is their invisibility. For several
        weeks, always at about the same time of day, the file of old women had hobbled
        past the house with their firewood, and though they had registered themselves
        on my eyeballs I cannot truly say that I had seen them. Firewood was
        passing&ndash;that was how I saw it. It was only that one day I happened to be
        walking behind them, and the curious up-and-down motion of a load of wood drew
        my attention to the human being underneath it. Then for the first time I
        noticed the poor old earth-coloured bodies, bodies reduced to bones and
        leathery skin, bent double under the crushing weight. Yet I suppose I had not
        been five minutes on Moroccan soil before I noticed the overloading of the
        donkeys and was infuriated by it. There is no question that the donkeys are
        damnably treated. The Moroccan donkey is hardly bigger than a St Bernard dog,
        it carries a load which in the British army would be considered too much for a
        fifteen-hands mule, and very often its pack-saddle is not taken off its back
        for weeks together. But what is peculiarly pitiful is that it is the most
        willing creature on earth, it follows its master like a dog and does not need
        either bridle or halter. After a dozen years of devoted work it suddenly drops
        dead, whereupon its master tips it into the ditch and the village dogs have
        torn its guts out before it is cold.</p>
        <p>This kind of thing makes one&rsquo;s blood boil, whereas&ndash;on the
        whole&ndash;the plight of the human beings does not. I am not commenting,
        merely pointing to a fact. People with brown skins are next door to invisible.
        Anyone can be sorry for the donkey with its galled back, but it is generally
        owing to some kind of accident if one even notices the old woman under her load
        of sticks.</p>
        <p>As the storks flew northward the Negroes were marching southward&ndash;a
        long, dusty column, infantry, screw-gun batteries and then more infantry, four
        or five thousand men in all, winding up the road with a clumping of boots and a
        clatter of iron wheels.</p>
        <p>They were Senegalese, the blackest Negroes in Africa, so black that
        sometimes it is difficult to see whereabouts on their necks the hair begins.
        Their splendid bodies were hidden in reach-me-down khaki uniforms, their feet
        squashed into boots that looked like blocks of wood, and every tin hat seemed
        to be a couple of sizes too small. It was very hot and the men had marched a
        long way. They slumped under the weight of their packs and the curiously
        sensitive black faces were glistening with sweat.</p>
        <p>As they went past a tall, very young Negro turned and caught my eye. But the
        look he gave me was not in the least the kind of look you might expect. Not
        hostile, not contemptuous, not sullen, not even inquisitive. It was the shy,
        wide-eyed Negro look, which actually is a look of profound respect. I saw how
        it was. This wretched boy, who is a French citizen and has therefore been
        dragged from the forest to scrub floors and catch syphilis in garrison towns,
        actually has feelings of reverence before a white skin. He has been taught that
        the white race are his masters, and he still believes it.</p>
        <p>But there is one thought which every white man (and in this connection it
        doesn&rsquo;t matter twopence if he calls himself a Socialist) thinks when he sees a
        black army marching past. &ldquo;How much longer can we go on kidding these people?
        How long before they turn their guns in the other direction?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>It was curious, really. Every white man there has this thought stowed
        somewhere or other in his mind. I had it, so had the other onlookers, so had
        the officers on their sweating chargers and the white NCOs marching in the
        ranks. It was a kind of secret which we all knew and were too clever to tell;
        only the Negroes didn&rsquo;t know it. And really it was almost like watching a flock
        of cattle to see the long column, a mile or two miles of armed men, flowing
        peacefully up the road, while the great white birds drifted over them in the
        opposite direction, glittering like scraps of paper.</p>
